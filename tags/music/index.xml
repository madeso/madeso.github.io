      <description>Development on the game engine has been slow this past week so this week Iâ€™ve been thinking about the background music for the game. I donâ€™t know the actual graphical style of the game just yet but I think I narrowed down the musical style to either some slow form of swing/jazz like this:&#xA;Or some some ambient 80â€™s style electro music like this.&#xA;Given the Iâ€™ve already found some electro music that seems to be fitting and that lander used some similar music pieces, itâ€™s safe to assume that I will be using that electro music during the early alpha builds.</description>

      <description>Since some time Iâ€™ve been sorting my music collection. Going though my hard-drives and Cdâ€™s finding all music-files and moving them to a common place and with the help of foobar2000 place them in a sane directory-structure and keep them there.&#xA;Within foobar I sort the artists on the following script.
