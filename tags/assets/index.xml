      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that I sacked tetris more than a month ago, gamedev has been pretty stale at the moment. I’ve been studying fighting-systems and analysing combo-lists for the fighting-system in survivors. The usual stuff. However since the last post I’ve been thinking about remaking &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yofrankie.org/&#34;&gt;Yo Frankie!&lt;/a&gt; with my tetris engine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tetris actually outlived it’s purpose, as the purpose of the tetris project was to build a solid foundation for survivors and all my other 3d games. So the purpose of Yo Frankie is to get a solid 3d game. The reason why tetris and Yo Frankie are a great choice for these games is that both tetris and Frankie have all defined game-play elements written down in stone and free media already available at start, I believe this is to be a huge motivational-booster. This is especially true in the case of Yo Frankie. I get free(cc licensed) good-looking 3d test data, with a cohesive design. On top of that it also includes high-quality animations and appropriate sound and music effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
