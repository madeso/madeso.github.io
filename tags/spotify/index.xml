      <title>A fix for spotify filling up the C: drive</title>

      <description>I recently got a notice that my SSD C: drive was getting low on space and after a quick check with WinDirStat I noticed that spoitfy was filling it up with loads of weird files in the AppData\Local\Spotify\Data folder, even after I have moved my cache location.
It turns out the &amp;ldquo;cached location&amp;rdquo; is only the saved playlists, and the Data folder is the cached songs that arent in a playlist.</description>
