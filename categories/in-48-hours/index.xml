      <description>Just another day at the office. Drink loads of coffee. Smoke cigarettes. Take credit for your co workers accomplishments. Go to pointless meetings and avoid getting fired.&#xA;Drink coffee and smoke so that you can work efficiently. Everyone is working on the same project, but you win if you did most of the work ! You can steal each other&amp;rsquo;s work by working at someone else&amp;rsquo;s desk.&#xA;Oh, also, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the meetings or your Boss will be angry!</description>

      <description>The Sloth dictator and his sloth generals are overseeing the Slothlympics.&#xA;Compete in the role of one of four animals and mash that button to get first to the finish line, but be careful: the dictator wants you to go slowly, so if they see you going fast, you&amp;rsquo;ll be penalized!&#xA;Mash the button to go faster, and use the other two to change lanes. If you get behind another runner, you can push them to make them go fast, and be penalized!</description>

      <description>Play as a the evil goat and kill innocent small rabbits and kill the heroes.&#xA;This ludum dare I spent most of the time on the transitions and never really had the time to make the gmaeplay interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s function but not much else. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate since I really like the graphics and transitions.</description>

      <description>Basic 2d shooter that never ends. Becomes a little tactical since the different enemies require you to aim and a limmited amount of bullets force you to venture to the middle of the level.</description>

      <description>Move the cursors away from the red items, charge and explode converting all reds into blue scores that need to be picked up before red can convert them.&#xA;Somewhat inspired by a mini game seen from somewhere and it shows. Not really a good game but kinda fun and from concept to implementation was less than a day so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess.</description>

      <description>This was my first ludum dare. I managed to get something playable but there isn&amp;rsquo;t much of a gameplay. Still pretty good for 48 hours and C++ from scratch.</description>
