      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; In my quest to make a complete game with each engine, this is my second game. My first game was made with a homegrown 3d engine in OpenGL with ODE. This one however is in 2d and uses HGE and bass(through HGE). My previous game was made in a month, this was made in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-game&#34;&gt;The Game&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game itself is based on a really old game for the mac that I liked, and I think it was called The 4th dimension, though I can only find a game dev company called 4th dimension. Anyway the game is 4 in a row in 3 dimensions. And as the original it is displayed in 2d. You can play against a friend or the computer(with hard and easy ai). As someone nicely pointed out, this should be played in 3 dimensions, but hey HGE can&amp;rsquo;t so I guess that if I ever remake this, I&amp;rsquo;ll make it in 3d&lt;/p&gt;</description>
