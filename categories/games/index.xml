      <description>Created for the 4e5 gamedev.net competition, this somewhat ambitious c++ ogree game was made. A bit too ambitious for the time I had available because unfortunatley time ran out and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly unfinished. It still contains some fun elements.</description>

      <description>This was my first ludum dare. I managed to get something playable but there isn&amp;rsquo;t much of a gameplay. Still pretty good for 48 hours and C++ from scratch.</description>

      <description>Play as a the evil goat and kill innocent small rabbits and kill the heroes.
This ludum dare I spent most of the time on the transitions and never really had the time to make the gmaeplay interesting. It&amp;rsquo;s function but not much else. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate since I really like the graphics and transitions.</description>

      <description>Move the cursors away from the red items, charge and explode converting all reds into blue scores that need to be picked up before red can convert them.
Somewhat inspired by a mini game seen from somewhere and it shows. Not really a good game but kinda fun and from concept to implementation was less than a day so that&amp;rsquo;s good I guess.</description>

      <description>Basic 2d shooter that never ends. Becomes a little tactical since the different enemies require you to aim and a limmited amount of bullets force you to venture to the middle of the level.</description>

      <description>Pretty basic platformer made for ludum dare in 48 hours. Surprisingly fun because of the unlimited air dashing and matching sound effects.</description>
