      <description>This week I started writing on the blog post that will become the second chapter of &amp;ldquo;clean code&amp;rdquo;. Should be up sometimes next week. I spent most of the weekend with running clang-tidy and porting my clang-tidy script to workbench, mostly because I wanted a html report now that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how pretty the header hero report looks :)</description>

      <description>This week I mostly wrote a blog post about Clean Code Chapter 2. I found a project called Header Hero that I might incorporate into my own header tool and started to refactor euphoria core library so I can get a better flow/structure and in preparation of the introduction of PCHs. Hopefully all will get the compilation times down to some form manageable levels.</description>

      <description>Introduction Clean Code, mostly authored by Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob, has come up lately in discussions and apparently it is still being read. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it and only read the responses about how bad it is and I&amp;rsquo;ve read that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty popular to hate on it and who am I to miss a trend. Join me as I read chapter to chapter and express my feelings and thoughts about each chapter.</description>

      <description>This week I fixed the last of the compiler warnings. Now euphoria builds without warnings on w4/Wall+extra. Next up to complete would proabably be to port the last of the build scripts and fix any warnings in euphoria that they will find.</description>

      <description>This week I started working on reducing the ammount of warnings euphoria generated. Thees things sometimes feels like whac-a-mole squishing warnings in clang and then find some new in msvc but it&amp;rsquo;s moving along.</description>

      <description>This week I started refactoring euph to CamelCase and I expect it will take a while for it to be complete. I thought I was done with core but running clang-tidy checks on it it seems I&amp;rsquo;ve still missed a few spots</description>

      <description>This week I continued working on tred. Cleaning up and mostly working on boring non-visible stuff. I started combining the 2d and 3d rendering and I think I have a pretty good API but it currently isn&amp;rsquo;t working. Have to look into why next week.</description>

      <description>This week I added both a brand new minesweeper clone and a old four-in-a-row in 3d clone that I made in 07. There is still some minor work to be done on both, but there are 2 game examples for fyro/tred now, hurray.</description>

      <description>This week I i removed the last of javascript references merged the lua branch of euphoria into master. Still a few places to clean up but I can move forward now with a better scriping engine. I am actually tempted to put all my efforts into a vertical slice of the engine so we&amp;rsquo;ll see in a week if I took action or continued cleaning up the code.</description>

      <description>This week I realized that lua perhaps could be a good candidate for scripting language, so I updated the lua fork to the lastest master.</description>

      <description>Haha. No rendering work this week. Instead I updated my infofile to more modern parsing without flex/bison and started updating my book.py script for creating e-books. That is also mostly done so I can get back to working on rendering in tred</description>

      <description>This week I got back into 3d rendering. I added basic face culling, simplified the mesh generation a bit and cleaned up the resource embed module. Not much but also not bad :)</description>

      <description>This week I switched tred to pitchfork layout and refactored it. I also spent most of my time on the &amp;lsquo;kittens game&amp;rsquo;, what a time waster.</description>

      <description>This week I looked into the markov-chains parts of euphoria (again), refactored a bit and expanded with a &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; test, a bit of fun really. I also thought about how I want to lay out the vertex attributes in tred. It currently is 100% dynamic butit will be easier if it&amp;rsquo;s static. A few days I ago I was sure I wanted a 50/50 approach but since I have to deal with all the dynamic issues anyway I might as well benefit from the potential space spacing and use 100% dynamic attributes.</description>

      <description>This week I worked both a little on ride(scrolling in fileview and expanding folders) and a little bit on tred(refactored profiling and added a plane mesh). Hopefully next week I make some decent progress on tred as I want to get it to a usefule state before the end of the year.</description>

      <description>This week I resurected ride and started implementing it more or less from scratch. Well, less wx and more custom so not from scratch, hopefully by the end of next week I can soon integrate most of the old code that still is relevant.</description>

      <description>This week I continued work on fel, since I realized that it would be great if I could have the interpreter run scripts and functions this year and let the &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; of the language come later but keeping the api the same.</description>

      <description>This week I fixed so that the euphoria tracery could handle extended json and added some more design notes for tred. I actually also started on a new project textgen where you generate textures by drawing graphs or writing lua code. Nothing to show yet but I only worked on it for 30 minutes.</description>

      <description>This week I copied the script used to create the &amp;lsquo;game programming patterns&amp;rsquo; book and rewrote most of it to be generic instead of tied to a specific book. Apperently it didn&amp;rsquo;t support ebook generation so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add that eventually. The rest of the week was spent on reading up on engine design and some refactoring of tred so no new major features.</description>

      <description>Less heat this week. I continued on tred, added uniforms and attributes to the shader and I finally think I got a good design going. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on getting uniform textures working fully. The plan is to work in tred for a month or two and then integrate it into euphoria. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This week I started working on tred, my temporary 3d engine. Nothing much got done since it&amp;rsquo;s currently superhot and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting behind a fan, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that for next year I&amp;rsquo;m getting myself an AC for the appartment cause this is unbearable. Until next time&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, but after much consideration I moved all the euphoria source to a src folder so that the project root is a bit cleaner.</description>

      <description>This week I changed to my main computer, started transfering my old PrettyGood.net from google code to github, and finally started working on euphoria again. This time I started working on a custom pixel editing program. It&amp;rsquo;s far from finished but I hope that it can be useful in a few weeks time for the GMTK game jam.</description>

      <description>This week I ported a old anagram application from c# to python, I published and updated old &amp;ldquo;engines&amp;rdquo;, one called hmtest and one called pwn-engine, so I could run them, but it turns out that none of them was that advanced. I also installed arch on my main, so either this week or the next my transition to arch will be complete</description>

      <description>This week I started refactoring bbcalc so it could in the future handle generating truth tables, and I physically moved things around so I now use arch as my main computer. It will probably be a week or two until I install it on my main machine, but not too long since this hardware isn&amp;rsquo;t really health&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This week I continued on euphoria argparser, adding a custom parser for non-standard elements. I started on running clang-tidy and clang-format on all the code, but it&amp;rsquo;s not done yet. I may end up adding a few options to clang-format so it can work with my code style, we&amp;rsquo;ll see. I also manage to uncover a old codestat project. A project intended to run on your codebase and gather statistics over time.</description>

      <description>This week I forgot my plan and bought some 3d assets on a black-friday sale so I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most, if not all, of my time integrating my level editor t3d into euphoria and trying to make it usable. I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed so that it loads the tile meshes and I&amp;rsquo;m currently adding collision detecion so I can add selection and interaction. Until next time.</description>

      <description>This week I added basic cp437 functions to euph and refactored the current font to use the utf8 character encoding instead of some unspecified encoding that looked like ascii. I moved some part of the rendering to core and replaced the rendering text on image with the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; core font instead of just the single built in font. With the increased intrest in text rendering/drawing with text and cp437 I looked into implementing part of the figlet specification, so that might happen.</description>

      <description>This week I found a cool piece of code that can display a tree in the terminal, and since it was MIT licensed I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on integrating it and making the API nice to use.</description>

      <description>This week I finished the kodsnack gamejam. I also bought a nerf distruptor. Not really related to development but I bought it as a stress reliever and it&amp;rsquo;s suprisingly fun to shoot at targets.</description>

      <description>This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much dev. I went to a C++ talk and while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as interesting as I hoped, it got me thinking. Why am I using C++14? I based my decision on that I want to port my engine to android and I discovered that they have now moved to C++17! So in the near future I will update my whole library to use 17. Yay!</description>

      <description>This week I was back at work, and the weekend was spent on real life stuff and working on a entry for the Kenney game jam. While I did work on the entry I ran out of time before I could finish the game. Since it was based on a previous project of mine I have inteded to finish but didn&amp;rsquo;t for various reasons I&amp;rsquo;m gonna consider this a start for actually finishing that game.</description>

      <description>This week I continued on my arch config quest. I updated my aur tool to be able to write updated dependencies per install instead of globally. It now also can tell the git commits between when you last wrote and the latest. I started writing a tool to create a new localized mirrors file based on the official one. Finally I started writing on a simple script to extract pngs at various resolutions from a svg file.</description>

      <description>This week I did a little on the json library but most of my time has either been spent on watch netflix and updating my arch installation. I switched over to dimming inactive windows and hiding the titlebar to get more screen estate and with the current compton settings, things actually look pretty.</description>

      <description>This week I started writing a json parser. I spent a little time on my AUR script, and wrote a script to randomly select a background. THere is still a few things to fix on my arch/i3 config before I can actually switch to it, on oh boy I am longing for the switch.</description>

      <description>This week I took a fel break and mostly spent it on implementing a table print function. I also threw out most of the fel parser and started writing a AST and runner, currently it can only print strings but with this approach it can be extended instead of writing it all at once.</description>

      <description>This week I completed the bfxr installations so that the build generates a installer and uploads it so people can use it, unfortunatly it looks like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so I have to investigate why. I also spent some time on euphoria making the vector/point refactor compile and I started a test if lua is a better scripting engine than js. So far I am not convinced.</description>

      <description>This week I started working, so my time is less than it was before, though I started to port the bfxr tool from flash back to c++ so I can use it again without problems. Still a few things to do but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up nicely.</description>

      <description>This week I continued my participation in the kodsnack spelsylt gamejam. While I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what I have achieved I might continue on and actually complete the game. It feels pretty good to play and I like the style of the game.</description>

      <description>This week I did some work on my synth project, starting to refactor the keyboard input from the actual sound synth so I can play with midi input some time in the future. I also made a skateboarding, mail delivery game for the gmtk2018 game jam called Skate and die. The name is obviously a nod to the classic &amp;ldquo;Skate or die&amp;rdquo; but what can you do when you get an idea that absolutly must be created?</description>

      <description>This week I threw out the wx scimed/ninepatch editor and have now a improved dear imgui version of it. There still are some non imgui like parts from the ported code but things are looking better. I just started on the imgui extension for gaf, and after that is completed I can work on saving json so I can close this chapter.</description>

      <description>This week I started on creating objects dynamically but it seems that I need to replace my component/entity engine first. I was planning to do so anyway since I dont like how it integrates with script defined components, but I thought this was something to do later. I guess not.</description>

      <description>This week I continued on writing the wrapper. It is pretty much almost done now. I know I said it was going to be done this week, but what can I say, things took longer than expected :)</description>

      <description>This week I started on replacing dukglue, my javascrip engine wrapper with a custom wrapper. While it is not completed yet, I got a good feeling about this.</description>

      <description>This week I added a crash display, so that the game enters a &amp;ldquo;blue screen&amp;rdquo; instead of crashing. At first I used my own built in debug print but then I replaced it with the much nicer dear imgui display. I also moved my duktape wrapper to core and started reasearching into replacing dukglue with a custom much simpler system.</description>

      <description>This week I finished up the basic javascript test that I wrote last week, and after two days of struggling on how to design the API I just went ahead and added the bare minimum input handling: keyboard buttons. Sooner or later I have to figure out how I should handle joysticks, gamepads, touch controls, vr controls, virtual buttons on touch controls etc. etc, but so far the everything is data driven, so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s nice.</description>

      <description>This week I fixed the javascript issue I was having. Still considering to write my own custom library, but that will have to wait. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 10 weeks until ludum dare so I have to get a move on if I want to use my framework for the game jam.</description>

      <description>This week I still mostly recovered from the flue. When I actually managed to find the time to code, I fought the duktype/dukglue registration of custom classes. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m considering discarding dukglue and writing my own simpler version.</description>

      <description>This week I wrote several different ECS systems before I decided to integrate the entt instead of using a custom one. I also decided that the first game will be a really basic version of tyrian.</description>

      <description>This week I decieded that I am gonna try to enter the april ludum dare jam with my own engine so I started planning out what needs to be done for that to happen. I ported my old unique id generator to euphoria and started to look into embedding javascript/typescript through duktape as a scriping language.</description>

      <description>This week I decided to up my rust game, so I started a pretty much completed a minor rust library called keyvalueextractor to extract data from a path. I ended the week with joining a game jam and creating the vr game &amp;ldquo;Inside sunshine&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This week I mostly spend either watching netflix movies or coding on euphoria/spaceyper. One of my new year resolutions is to complete a few projects, including fish hunt, space typer and star collector. Of all the projects fish hunt is the one that is most completed. Star collector comes second but that is an android project so releasing that is another project entirly. Until next week.</description>

      <description>This week I continued working on spacetyper and started a semi new project. A basic chatbot. Given that I am leaving for xmas celebrations, the week isnt over, and I&amp;rsquo;m switching to my laptop I probably will continue working on fishhunt for the rest of the week. Stay tuned for next week.</description>

      <description>This week I found a few assets and started combining them in unity. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s a small game, it shouldnt take that long to complete. Fingers crossed.</description>

      <description>This week I implemented the ray-sphere collision, and tested it by highlightin all the intersections. I realized that a simple check such as this would be suitable for clicking on the closest object so I need to implement more acurate ray collisions.</description>

      <description>This week I finished implementing the aabb collison check, but realized that I probably need a sphere/ray intersection instead as that would work regardless of the rotation of the object.</description>

      <description>This week I completed the basic outline feature to each actor/mesh so I can highlight the current selected tile/actor in t3d. I also started work on getting a ray so I can actually select.</description>

      <description>This week I actually did a little work on t3d. I started on a tile library and fixed a problem with the mesh loader in euphoria. I loaded the ambient color and assimp defaulted to a black ambient, but since most models only specify diffuse I added a option to assume the ambient color is the same as the diffuse color.</description>

      <description>This week I was lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I rediscovered agents of shield and spent way to much time watching episodes I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. Then I spent some time on t3d, but way way less than I wanted.</description>

      <description>This week I started on rewriting ride in rust. From the ground up. I have some really basic custom input control in the GTK build, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to get a proper text rendering system up before I can continue. I also started working on a 3d level editor that I need for any game. Not much progress as I just grabbed the demo application and started removing things from it.</description>

      <description>This week I continued on the rect and image refactoring, added a few image drawing tests and added base64 support so I can test image loading without being dependent on actual files. Finally I updated the dear imgui library to get access to the new color widget.</description>

      <description>This week I was back on work and even though my time was more limited, I still managed to do a little bit on the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;. I added clang-tidy and clang-format as a optional step in the build process. I then continued on fixing almost all the error that clang-tidy found. That took the better part of the week. Then I added basic lightning to the engine demo.</description>

      <description>This week I mostly spent on binge watching Agents of Shield (again), and did some real world stuff, however I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d want to use my own 3d engine for my next game jam, so I spent a significant part of the weekend on this engine. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be in a useful state for the Kenney jam on a month.</description>

Work on the graph widget has been lacking theese last weeks and I desperetly both want and need it to be finished.</description>

      <description>This was a little bit better. I watched a little bit of netflix, but converted the current deploy script from bash to python so I, in the future, can add more advanced image rezising functions that hugo currently doesnt support. Then I pretty much started the konmari appartment cleanup so I guess I wont get much development stuff done for a couple of weeks.</description>

      <description>I recently got a notice that my SSD C: drive was getting low on space and after a quick check with WinDirStat I noticed that spoitfy was filling it up with loads of weird files in the AppData\Local\Spotify\Data folder, even after I have moved my cache location.
It turns out the &amp;ldquo;cached location&amp;rdquo; is only the saved playlists, and the Data folder is the cached songs that arent in a playlist.</description>

      <description>This week should have been spent on either gaf, t3d or finishing the spacetyper menu but it was spent on finishing crappy series on netflix instead. I guess the blame is mostly on the bad cycle of beeing too tired and then just binge watching myself one more episode past bedtime.</description>

      <description>This week I continued working on this homepage, scaling images to fit in the design and it&amp;rsquo;s taking longer than expected. I also finally restarted my tile based 3d level editor called t3d. Since it&amp;rsquo;s still in its infancy there arent any pretty pictures so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it here in the devlog for now.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing that much last week. Instead of staring designing or coding the 2d rendering system I started on separating the engine repo from the game repo, but nothing is complete yet. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to finish it this week.</description>

It is really quite simple. First you need to install it, unless you already have it installed:
$ sudo apt-get install acpitool Once it&amp;rsquo;s installed you can list what you can do with it, and to make it works.</description>

      <description>Recursive search is the default in nautilus (search in subfolders), but I prefer type ahead search(only search in current folder).
This is easy to change, but not very obvious. In dconf-editor navigate to org &amp;gt; gnome &amp;gt; nautilus &amp;gt; preferences and set the enable-interactive-search value to what you&amp;rsquo;d like to use.

You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.</description>

      <description>I really want to release a demo to get a feedback on the actual game, but there are a few things that I think should be fixed before I release a early preview build:
 Redesign the hardcoded input system, I’m working on this now Add lights and shadows to the renderer, this will really help the player determine the depth when flying around and help immersion Add 2d rendering/menu, this will provide the GUI for the “press start to play” so the game know what control to accept input from Physics motor, this is perhaps the most important feature.</description>

      <description>I have started implementing the basic controls for both the keyboard and joysticks and to test everything out I added basic thrust and torque controls, and while this is really hard to control as each torque requires a counter torque from stopping to spinning I started thinking. The WebGL version of lander and I recall the original (I still can’t get it to play on my win7 system) let’s you enter the desired orientation and let a AI controls the torque thrusts.</description>

      <title>The music</title>

      <description>Development on the game engine has been slow this past week so this week I’ve been thinking about the background music for the game. I don’t know the actual graphical style of the game just yet but I think I narrowed down the musical style to either some slow form of swing/jazz like this:
  Or some some ambient 80’s style electro music like this.
Given the I’ve already found some electro music that seems to be fitting and that lander used some similar music pieces, it’s safe to assume that I will be using that electro music during the early alpha builds.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Distribution</title>

      <description>This week instead of talking just design I thought I would be nice to share some development ideas that I’ve been brewing for a while, and it has to do with distribution of the game. The obvious choice is steam, and probably the equivalent to the appstore on ubuntu(if that still exists and is flourishing), but a part of me wants to sell the game to all linux distributions and I can’t test that at all.</description>

      <description>I though this is good time to talk and clarify a little about the game and blog title, and how misleading that title might be.
First and foremost the game is not set in space. The game might take place on different planets and you might travel from these places, but this is not part of the game.
Neither is hustling of any kind. You are a soldier/mercenary/technician for hire, you do your job and you get paid, so no hustling whatsoever.</description>

      <description>I attended the nordic game indie night, and got to play flowstorm (that did a kickstarter) and realized 2 things: It’t a really hard game and that it’s also a lander-like 2d game. Check it out if you haven’t already.</description>

      <description>So I decided that I need to make a bigger game, a game that I can work on for a few months at least and not get bored. I shouldn’t have any complicated animations and should be “easy” to make. A basic renderer on the top of a physics simulation won’t be that complicated and could be fun.
I thought about remaking a previous game of mine, lolball, but all the design I could come up with was way to complicated for what I had imagined.</description>

      <description>Whoa… almost 5 months since last time! I gotta post more than twice a year 🙂
Anyways, I’ve been quite busy since last time:
 My pwn game library is still in development. and I’ve entered ludum dare twice..  I’ve posted my first entry, let’s go cave exploring, earlier in this blog. My second entry for the “Explore” theme was “Xplorer – the game” a kinda unfinished 2-player game that ends when everything is explored</description>

      <description>Since last time I’ve entered Ludum Dare and actually finished at 75ths place and a bronze in community – yay me.
Since then I’ve integrated the half/16-bit float from the glorious OpenEXR-project into my game-library pwn.
I’ve also been thinking about creating a 2d level editor as editing text-files suck, and there doesn’t seem to be a good level-editor. Most of the 2d level editors are focused on tile-based editing, but I want a more free-flow sprite-based editor, like the aquaria editor(nicely captured by wolfire design tour) or the boingo editor that is briefly visible in their sga trailer.</description>

      <description>I probably should have posted this earlier, however I been sleeping and sobbing over the fact that I didn’t finish no more sweden :). A few hours before deadline all tiles in one layer went 3 tiles up, but collision-tiles were still in the same place. I though that was strange so I went to check the map in the (external) editor, and to my horror it didn’t load. No message, no crash nor any exception – just silence.</description>

      <description>So I’m attending this game-jam called No more sweden(funny name) this week. Wednesday/Thursday to Saturday/Sunday. I’ll be attending most of it, though I have to work at Thursday and Friday, which is a bummer, so Ive been thinking at what kind of game I’m be making. I’ve been thinking about making a simple plat former for some time now, and this might be good time as any to make it a reality.</description>

      <description>Given that I sacked tetris more than a month ago, gamedev has been pretty stale at the moment. I’ve been studying fighting-systems and analysing combo-lists for the fighting-system in survivors. The usual stuff. However since the last post I’ve been thinking about remaking Yo Frankie! with my tetris engine.
Tetris actually outlived it’s purpose, as the purpose of the tetris project was to build a solid foundation for survivors and all my other 3d games.</description>

      <description>I recently read scarabus’ post regarding guis and I wanted to follow up/ add a few notes of my own. Since scarabus considers blender to have the worst user-interface(ui for short), I’m going to compare it to other similar applications and guess why it might be non-intuitive.
So, beeing picky I have tried several mesh modelers. The imcomplete list is anim8or, google sketchup, misfit model 3d, xsi modtool, blender, art of illusion, truespace and wings 3d.</description>

      <description>I recently came to the conclusion that I wont continue tetris, and instead restart my third person shooter-beatemup zombie &amp;amp; soldier slayfest Survivors. I always knew I was going back to survivors, I just didn’t know that I was going to give up on tetris. In reality it has to do with I got bored and can’t come up with a satisfying way of designing the menys. It sucks really, but all of the time wont go to waste since most of the code is basic boilerplate and I’m happy with most of the layout.</description>

      <description>Apparently the pulse didnt came. Now my biggest problem apperently is if I’m such a great nerd because I noticed or I blogged about it.
 On June 1, 2009, months after Max’s escape, terrorists detonate an electromagnetic pulse weapon in the atmosphere over the U.S., which destroys the vast majority of computer and communication systems, throwing the country into utter chaos.

      <description>I recently discovered, not only do the local library have CD’s full of modern music, with my chemical romance-blood among others(despite what you think of chemical romance, blood really is different), they also have a complete collection of sound fx CD’s. I guess I dont have to spend some of my hard earned money on thoose sorts of CD’s when I can borrow 🙂</description>

      <description>Since some time I’ve been sorting my music collection. Going though my hard-drives and Cd’s finding all music-files and moving them to a common place and with the help of foobar2000 place them in a sane directory-structure and keep them there.
Within foobar I sort the artists on the following script. This makes sure that The (International) Noise Conspiracy is among the other artist that begins with I.
$replace($replace($replace($stripprefix(%artist%),’|’,),&#39;[‘,),&#39;(‘,)  That little script keeps things nice and tidy within foobar, but to sort I use these two massive scripts:</description>

      <description>.. and I’m a game programmer. My best game so far would probably be lolball. A game where you move through levels as fast as possible to get a better score, all while doing as many combos as possible. Did I mention particle effects and slow-motion? Currently however I’m working on a remake of tetris so I can get a stable codebase for my next progress.
Until next time…</description>

      <description>As the current year is slowly coming to a close, I figured that it would be smart to make a few promises. The first would be to actually add a new post once in a while, say every week, instead of once a year. So who am I…? Stay tuned for my next update 🙂</description>
