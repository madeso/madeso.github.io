      <description>This week I continued working on this homepage, scaling images to fit in the design and it&amp;rsquo;s taking longer than expected. I also finally restarted my tile based 3d level editor called t3d. Since it&amp;rsquo;s still in its infancy there arent any pretty pictures so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it here in the devlog for now.</description>

      <description>Much of the page is now in &amp;ldquo;kinda working&amp;rdquo; order. There are still projects missing images and download links, and most projects have the wrong header image size. There only one thing to do, and that&amp;rsquo;s keep on working on it.</description>

      <description>Last week was kinda productive despite a birthday party in Germany. I finally started on gaf, the game format file format generator, and separated the game and the engine part of spacetyper into super and sub repos.</description>

      <description>Last week wasn&amp;rsquo;t that eventful. Life got in my way I guess so no code was neither written nor committed. Better luck next(this) week I guess&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I did nothing at all this week except watching Netflix. I managed to watch the entire Jessica Jones season 1 though so I&amp;rsquo;m both proud and appalled about my accomplishment.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing that much last week. Instead of staring designing or coding the 2d rendering system I started on separating the engine repo from the game repo, but nothing is complete yet. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to finish it this week.</description>

      <description>This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, except implementing radix sort with count sort as the second sorter. Pretty standard I guess but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my toolbox library and I will need it for the upcoming render optimization</description>

      <description>This week I replaced the built-in assert with a custom one to get callstack information, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also finally completed the rewrite of the new opengl buffer rendering.</description>

      <description>I recently bought new shoes and needed to lace them, hence it&amp;rsquo;s time to google how to lace shoes again. Ians shoelace site is my favorite and I&amp;rsquo;ve been visiting it for what it seems like an eternity. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the competition, but I can&amp;rsquo;t find anything missing from it. It&amp;rsquo;s the best!

      <title>Keep your ubuntu-gnome from waking up at random</title>

      <description>I have tried using /proc/acpi/wakeup and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried looking in /sys/bus/usb/devices/SOMETHING/power/wakeup for devices that will wake up the computer, however I finally fixed my random wakeup problems with a tool called acpitool.
It is really quite simple. First you need to install it, unless you already have it installed:
$ sudo apt-get install acpitool  Once it&amp;rsquo;s installed you can list what you can do with it, and to make it works.</description>

      <title>Non recursive file searching in Nautilus</title>
      <link>https://madeso.github.io/blog/nonerecursivesearch/</link>

      <guid>https://madeso.github.io/blog/nonerecursivesearch/</guid>
      <description>Recursive search is the default in nautilus (search in subfolders), but I prefer type ahead search(only search in current folder).
This is easy to change, but not very obvious. In dconf-editor navigate to org &amp;gt; gnome &amp;gt; nautilus &amp;gt; preferences and set the enable-interactive-search value to what you&amp;rsquo;d like to use.

      <description>It turns out google has removed it from various links, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long this link will last, but here it goes:

Pretty simple but it took far too long to find it.</description>

      <description>I like to view folders before my files with Files/Nautilus, and here is how to enable it:
In dconf-editor navigate to: org.gnome.nautilus.preferences key and set sort-directories-first to true.</description>

      <title>Test markdown</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a code chunk with syntax highlighting:
var foo = function(x) { return(x + 5); } foo(3)  $ echo $EDITOR vim $ git checkout master Switched to branch &#39;master&#39; Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;. $ git push Everything up-to-date $ echo &#39;All &amp;gt; done!&#39; All done!  You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.</description>
