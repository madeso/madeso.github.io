      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed and cleaned up the windows build, removed libraries that
aren&amp;rsquo;t and shouldnt be used, I wrote a custom typeinfo code and made
ctti optional. Finally I started on a refactor of the vector classes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did some cleanup but most of my time was spent on removing the RTTI requirement from euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent on refactoring my duktype binding library for euphoria. Much has been done, but there is also more to be done before I am finished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much. I read some code, thought about the future and what I wanted to do and spent some time updating my i3 installation. Hopefully next week will have been more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the second season of Iron Fist, and continued onto the first
season of Merlin. I also bought a midi controller and added a basic hacky midi input to my synth project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented a really basic arpegiator to my synth project, and spent
the remainder catching a cold, catching up on my MCU and Season 2 of Iron Fist
while getting and recovering from a fever and said cold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did some work on my synth project, starting to refactor the keyboard
input from the actual sound synth so I can play with midi input some time in
the future. I also made a skateboarding, mail delivery game for the gmtk2018 game
jam called &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018/rate/299793&#34;&gt;Skate and die&lt;/a&gt;.
The name is obviously a nod to the classic &amp;ldquo;Skate or die&amp;rdquo; but what can you do
when you get an idea that absolutly must be created?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working again. I did a little work on my software synth and my dotfiles management util/script. In less than a week is the gmtk gamejam and I&amp;rsquo;m getting hyped.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on software synth, and participated in game jam but didn&amp;rsquo;t
really finish it :( On the upside is I added a feature to the assimp library
and terminal application that I soon hopefully will add via a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was my first vacation and I added a OnInit function and creation arguments
to the the create function in euphoria. I also, in preperation of the upcomming gamejams,
started to play around with godot a bit and started on a smaller platformer test/game thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week a heatwave struck, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much. I started on the
OnInit callback, but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I made it so that shots are destroyed when the have left the viewport.
I also started laying the grounds for adding a init function for when creating entities.&lt;/p&gt;
