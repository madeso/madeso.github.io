      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on spacetyper and started a semi new project.
A basic chatbot. Given that I am leaving for xmas celebrations, the week isnt over,
and I&amp;rsquo;m switching to my laptop I probably will continue working on fishhunt for
the rest of the week. Stay tuned for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly worked on upgrading spacetyper to the latest euphoria
codebase. I really should have worked on completing fishhunt but I wanted to
code some C++ for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game is shaping up. Not much left now. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for a release next week or
the week after that, before x-mas at least.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I found a few assets and started combining them in unity. Given that
it&amp;rsquo;s a small game, it shouldnt take that long to complete. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I pretty much continued on star collector. It&amp;rsquo;s progressing
nicely and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be done before or arount X-mas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I decided I should actually complete my older projects colelcting dust,
so I took an old project of mine, starcollector, and started polishing it.
I hope that I can actually complete it this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do much at all. I pretty much just watched random episodes of How I Met Your Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented the ray-sphere collision, and tested it by highlightin
all the intersections. I realized that a simple check such as this would be suitable
for clicking on the closest object so I need to implement more acurate ray collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished implementing the aabb collison check, but realized that I probably
need a sphere/ray intersection instead as that would work regardless of the rotation of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the basic outline feature to each actor/mesh so I can highlight
the current selected tile/actor in t3d. I also started work on getting a ray so I can actually select.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I actually did a little work on t3d. I started on a tile library and
fixed a problem with the mesh loader in euphoria. I loaded the ambient color and
assimp defaulted to a black ambient, but since most models only specify diffuse
I added a option to assume the ambient color is the same as the diffuse color.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I rediscovered agents of shield and spent
way to much time watching episodes I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. Then I spent some time on t3d,
but way way less than I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on rewriting ride in rust. From the ground up. I have some
really basic custom input control in the GTK build, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to get a proper
text rendering system up before I can continue. I also started working on a
3d level editor that I need for any game. Not much progress as I just grabbed
the demo application and started removing things from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added a linux build on Travis CI and a Windows build on Appveyour. The linux build runs my unit tests and the windows currently only builds. Testing comes later.&lt;/p&gt;
