      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less heat this week. I continued on tred, added uniforms and attributes to the shader and I finally think I got a good design going. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on getting uniform textures working fully. The plan is to work in tred for a month or two and then integrate it into euphoria. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on tred, my temporary 3d engine. Nothing much got done since it&amp;rsquo;s currently superhot and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting behind a fan, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that for next year I&amp;rsquo;m getting myself an AC for the appartment cause this is unbearable. Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, but after much consideration I moved all the euphoria source to a src folder so that the project root is a bit cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theese past weeks I spent in the hospital and recovering from said experience. Nothing major was done really mostly config/dotfiles changes. Hopefully I will get back to euphoria I netflix will stop interfering :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly watched netfix and such but I did manage to implement a simple fill tool for the pixel image editor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I changed to my main computer, started transfering my old PrettyGood.net from google code to github, and finally started working on euphoria again. This time I started working on a custom pixel editing program. It&amp;rsquo;s far from finished but I hope that it can be useful in a few weeks time for the GMTK game jam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I ported a old anagram application from c# to python, I published and updated old &amp;ldquo;engines&amp;rdquo;, one called hmtest and one called pwn-engine, so I could run them, but it turns out that none of them was that advanced. I also installed arch on my main, so either this week or the next my transition to arch will be complete&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started refactoring bbcalc so it could in the future handle generating truth tables, and I physically moved things around so I now use arch as my main computer. It will probably be a week or two until I install it on my main machine, but not too long since this hardware isn&amp;rsquo;t really health&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on getting a gui sample up and running. Due to issues I also ended up creating a 2d sample. There are only a few issues left before I can continue on adding features to the ui&lt;/p&gt;
