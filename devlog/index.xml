      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I wrote several different ECS systems before I decided to integrate
the entt instead of using a custom one. I also decided that the first game
will be a really basic version of tyrian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I decieded that I am gonna try to enter the april ludum dare jam with
my own engine so I started planning out what needs to be done for that to happen.
I ported my old unique id generator to euphoria and started to look into
embedding javascript/typescript through duktape as a scriping language.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I decided to up my rust game, so I started a pretty much completed a
minor rust library called keyvalueextractor to extract data from a path. I ended
the week with joining a game jam and creating the vr game &amp;ldquo;Inside sunshine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished the spacetyper/euphoria font rendering rewrite and finally
managed to add inlined icons in text when rendering. I also somehow managed to
binge the entire first season of punisher.&lt;/p&gt;

coordinate system correct and fixing so that the padding/margin -top/bottom
values werent mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spend either watching netflix movies or coding on
euphoria/spaceyper. One of my new year resolutions is to complete a few projects,
including fish hunt, space typer and star collector. Of all the projects fish hunt
is the one that is most completed. Star collector comes second but that is an
android project so releasing that is another project entirly. Until next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on the chatbot and updating the euphoria engine. In a

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on spacetyper and started a semi new project.
A basic chatbot. Given that I am leaving for xmas celebrations, the week isnt over,
and I&amp;rsquo;m switching to my laptop I probably will continue working on fishhunt for
the rest of the week. Stay tuned for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly worked on upgrading spacetyper to the latest euphoria
codebase. I really should have worked on completing fishhunt but I wanted to
code some C++ for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game is shaping up. Not much left now. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for a release next week or
the week after that, before x-mas at least.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I found a few assets and started combining them in unity. Given that
it&amp;rsquo;s a small game, it shouldnt take that long to complete. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I pretty much continued on star collector. It&amp;rsquo;s progressing
nicely and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be done before or arount X-mas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I decided I should actually complete my older projects colelcting dust,
so I took an old project of mine, starcollector, and started polishing it.
I hope that I can actually complete it this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented the ray-sphere collision, and tested it by highlightin
all the intersections. I realized that a simple check such as this would be suitable
for clicking on the closest object so I need to implement more acurate ray collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
