      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I resurected ride and started implementing it more or less from scratch. Well, less wx and more custom so not from scratch, hopefully by the end of next week I can soon integrate most of the old code that still is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started work on the inerpreter part of the fel language/implementation and a little bit of constexpr for the euphoria engine. Most of the week however has been planning for the new appartment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel, since I realized that it would be great if I could have the interpreter run scripts and functions this year and let the &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; of the language come later but keeping the api the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on basic profiler for tred, I picked up euphoria and started cleaning up the cmake setup and continued work on gaf so that it&amp;rsquo;s more streamlined faster testing and contains the features that I want in euphoria&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed so that the euphoria tracery could handle extended json and added some more design notes for tred. I actually also started on a new project textgen where you generate textures by drawing graphs or writing lua code. Nothing to show yet but I only worked on it for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I copied the script used to create the &amp;lsquo;game programming patterns&amp;rsquo; book and rewrote most of it to be generic instead of tied to a specific book. Apperently it didn&amp;rsquo;t support ebook generation so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add that eventually. The rest of the week was spent on reading up on engine design and some refactoring of tred so no new major features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spent watching netflix. Lazy I know but I atleast structure the todo list and think on how the tred api will be layed out&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less heat this week. I continued on tred, added uniforms and attributes to the shader and I finally think I got a good design going. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on getting uniform textures working fully. The plan is to work in tred for a month or two and then integrate it into euphoria. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on tred, my temporary 3d engine. Nothing much got done since it&amp;rsquo;s currently superhot and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting behind a fan, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that for next year I&amp;rsquo;m getting myself an AC for the appartment cause this is unbearable. Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, but after much consideration I moved all the euphoria source to a src folder so that the project root is a bit cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theese past weeks I spent in the hospital and recovering from said experience. Nothing major was done really mostly config/dotfiles changes. Hopefully I will get back to euphoria I netflix will stop interfering :)&lt;/p&gt;
