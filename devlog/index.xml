      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented a really basic arpegiator to my synth project, and spent
the remainder catching a cold, catching up on my MCU and Season 2 of Iron Fist
while getting and recovering from a fever and said cold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did some work on my synth project, starting to refactor the keyboard
input from the actual sound synth so I can play with midi input some time in
the future. I also made a skateboarding, mail delivery game for the gmtk2018 game
jam called &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018/rate/299793&#34;&gt;Skate and die&lt;/a&gt;.
The name is obviously a nod to the classic &amp;ldquo;Skate or die&amp;rdquo; but what can you do
when you get an idea that absolutly must be created?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working again. I did a little work on my software synth and my dotfiles management util/script. In less than a week is the gmtk gamejam and I&amp;rsquo;m getting hyped.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on software synth, and participated in game jam but didn&amp;rsquo;t
really finish it :( On the upside is I added a feature to the assimp library
and terminal application that I soon hopefully will add via a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was my first vacation and I added a OnInit function and creation arguments
to the the create function in euphoria. I also, in preperation of the upcomming gamejams,
started to play around with godot a bit and started on a smaller platformer test/game thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week a heatwave struck, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much. I started on the
OnInit callback, but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I made it so that shots are destroyed when the have left the viewport.
I also started laying the grounds for adding a init function for when creating entities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I merged the main.cc from all various applications in the euphoria
framework, extracting all the copy-paste code into another utility file.
I also finally came up with how to best handle how to check for when objects
are outside the viewport, so that should be done soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished the viewport logic, and started looking at how to handle objects getting outside of the view. Not uch but I also binged luke cage season 2, so pretty ok progress considering.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent on watching luke cage season 2, adding enum support to imgui
option for gaf, fixed the issue with not resusing ids and started on writing
viewport handling. The latter is not quite finished yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I threw out the wx scimed/ninepatch editor and have now a improved
dear imgui version of it. There still are some non imgui like parts from the ported
code but things are looking better. I just started on the imgui extension for gaf,
and after that is completed I can work on saving json so I can close this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
