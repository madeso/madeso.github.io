      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added a linux build on Travis CI and a Windows build on Appveyour. The linux build runs my unit tests and the windows currently only builds. Testing comes later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do that much. I sorted game ideas, and other non-game ideas. The most actual development I did was when I created a git alias to list all commit messages and created a wordcloud of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on the rect and image refactoring, added a few image
drawing tests and added base64 support so I can test image loading without being
dependent on actual files. Finally I updated the dear imgui library to get
access to the new color widget.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on the engine, loading advanced meshes, default
textures in the shader and replaced google test in favour of catch. At the
weekend I participated in kenney jam and made a breakout clone in unity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was back on work and even though my time was more limited, I still
managed to do a little bit on the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;. I added clang-tidy and clang-format
as a optional step in the build process. I then continued on fixing almost all the
error that clang-tidy found. That took the better part of the week. Then I added
basic lightning to the engine demo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After several days I&amp;rsquo;m back home and back to roughly the same posting shedule. I spent the lasat vacation week with working on &amp;ldquo;the engine&amp;rdquo; and it is slowly getting there, but as I get back to work I expect things to slow down quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;, but I dont think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use it on my next jam as time is slowly running out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spent on binge watching Agents of Shield (again), and did some real world stuff, however I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d want to use my own 3d engine
for my next game jam, so I spent a significant part of the weekend on this engine. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be in a useful state for the Kenney jam on a month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do much, and I&amp;rsquo;m honestly not sure what I did except work related stuff, shopping a few new furnitures and attending a birthday party. Work on the graph widget has been lacking theese last weeks and I desperetly both want and need it to be finished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly watched season 4 of &amp;ldquo;Agents of Shield&amp;rdquo;, but I also added proper smiley graphics and pagination and fixed a bug causing the image on some pages to not be displayed so at least I made some progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on a project called nodecalc. It aims to replace my need for most excel/open office calc needs by calculating expressions in a graph like manner instead of referencing cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent time learning various unity things, trying to up my unity game. I also started learning blender and trying (and failing) to make a 3d character.&lt;/p&gt;
