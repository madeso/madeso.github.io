      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spent on binge watching Agents of Shield (again), and did some real world stuff, however I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d want to use my own 3d engine
for my next game jam, so I spent a significant part of the weekend on this engine. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be in a useful state for the Kenney jam on a month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do much, and I&amp;rsquo;m honestly not sure what I did except work related stuff, shopping a few new furnitures and attending a birthday party. Work on the graph widget has been lacking theese last weeks and I desperetly both want and need it to be finished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly watched season 4 of &amp;ldquo;Agents of Shield&amp;rdquo;, but I also added proper smiley graphics and pagination and fixed a bug causing the image on some pages to not be displayed so at least I made some progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on a project called nodecalc. It aims to replace my need for most excel/open office calc needs by calculating expressions in a graph like manner instead of referencing cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent time learning various unity things, trying to up my unity game. I also started learning blender and trying (and failing) to make a 3d character.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week started with a small project of creating a tracery.io commandline application in C++. It currently missing some advanced features but it was a nice break in the great konmari cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a little bit better. I watched a little bit of netflix, but converted the current deploy script from bash to python
so I, in the future, can add more advanced image rezising functions that hugo currently doesnt support. Then I pretty much
started the konmari appartment cleanup so I guess I wont get much development stuff done for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was also lazy. What can I say, except I&amp;rsquo;ve now binged one more series on netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week should have been spent on either gaf, t3d or finishing the spacetyper menu but it was spent on finishing crappy series on netflix instead. I guess the blame is mostly on the bad cycle of beeing too tired and then just binge watching myself one more episode past bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on this homepage, scaling images to fit in the design and it&amp;rsquo;s taking longer than expected. I also finally restarted my tile based 3d level editor called t3d. Since it&amp;rsquo;s still in its infancy there arent any pretty pictures so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it here in the devlog for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the page is now in &amp;ldquo;kinda working&amp;rdquo; order. There are still projects
missing images and download links, and most projects have the wrong
header image size. There only one thing to do, and that&amp;rsquo;s keep on working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did a little work on gaf, but my whole weeked was spent on moving my blogs and page to this new hugo based page. It isn&amp;rsquo;t done yet, but hopefully soon.&lt;/p&gt;
