      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented the ray-sphere collision, and tested it by highlightin
all the intersections. I realized that a simple check such as this would be suitable
for clicking on the closest object so I need to implement more acurate ray collisions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished implementing the aabb collison check, but realized that I probably
need a sphere/ray intersection instead as that would work regardless of the rotation of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the basic outline feature to each actor/mesh so I can highlight
the current selected tile/actor in t3d. I also started work on getting a ray so I can actually select.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I actually did a little work on t3d. I started on a tile library and
fixed a problem with the mesh loader in euphoria. I loaded the ambient color and
assimp defaulted to a black ambient, but since most models only specify diffuse
I added a option to assume the ambient color is the same as the diffuse color.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I rediscovered agents of shield and spent
way to much time watching episodes I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. Then I spent some time on t3d,
but way way less than I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on rewriting ride in rust. From the ground up. I have some
really basic custom input control in the GTK build, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to get a proper
text rendering system up before I can continue. I also started working on a
3d level editor that I need for any game. Not much progress as I just grabbed
the demo application and started removing things from it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added a linux build on Travis CI and a Windows build on Appveyour. The linux build runs my unit tests and the windows currently only builds. Testing comes later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do that much. I sorted game ideas, and other non-game ideas. The most actual development I did was when I created a git alias to list all commit messages and created a wordcloud of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on the rect and image refactoring, added a few image
drawing tests and added base64 support so I can test image loading without being
dependent on actual files. Finally I updated the dear imgui library to get
access to the new color widget.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on the engine, loading advanced meshes, default
textures in the shader and replaced google test in favour of catch. At the
weekend I participated in kenney jam and made a breakout clone in unity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was back on work and even though my time was more limited, I still
managed to do a little bit on the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;. I added clang-tidy and clang-format
as a optional step in the build process. I then continued on fixing almost all the
error that clang-tidy found. That took the better part of the week. Then I added
basic lightning to the engine demo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After several days I&amp;rsquo;m back home and back to roughly the same posting shedule. I spent the lasat vacation week with working on &amp;ldquo;the engine&amp;rdquo; and it is slowly getting there, but as I get back to work I expect things to slow down quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;, but I dont think I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use it on my next jam as time is slowly running out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spent on binge watching Agents of Shield (again), and did some real world stuff, however I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d want to use my own 3d engine
for my next game jam, so I spent a significant part of the weekend on this engine. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be in a useful state for the Kenney jam on a month.&lt;/p&gt;
