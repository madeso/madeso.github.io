      <description>This week I started on a project called nodecalc. It aims to replace my need for most excel/open office calc needs by calculating expressions in a graph like manner instead of referencing cells.</description>

      <description>This week started with a small project of creating a tracery.io commandline application in C++. It currently missing some advanced features but it was a nice break in the great konmari cleansing.</description>

      <description>This was a little bit better. I watched a little bit of netflix, but converted the current deploy script from bash to python so I, in the future, can add more advanced image rezising functions that hugo currently doesnt support. Then I pretty much started the konmari appartment cleanup so I guess I wont get much development stuff done for a couple of weeks.</description>

      <description>This week should have been spent on either gaf, t3d or finishing the spacetyper menu but it was spent on finishing crappy series on netflix instead. I guess the blame is mostly on the bad cycle of beeing too tired and then just binge watching myself one more episode past bedtime.</description>

      <description>This week I continued working on this homepage, scaling images to fit in the design and it&amp;rsquo;s taking longer than expected. I also finally restarted my tile based 3d level editor called t3d. Since it&amp;rsquo;s still in its infancy there arent any pretty pictures so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it here in the devlog for now.</description>

      <description>Much of the page is now in &amp;ldquo;kinda working&amp;rdquo; order. There are still projects missing images and download links, and most projects have the wrong header image size. There only one thing to do, and that&amp;rsquo;s keep on working on it.</description>

      <description>This week I did a little work on gaf, but my whole weeked was spent on moving my blogs and page to this new hugo based page. It isn&amp;rsquo;t done yet, but hopefully soon.</description>

      <description>Last week was kinda productive despite a birthday party in Germany. I finally started on gaf, the game format file format generator, and separated the game and the engine part of spacetyper into super and sub repos.</description>

      <description>Last week wasn&amp;rsquo;t that eventful. Life got in my way I guess so no code was neither written nor committed. Better luck next(this) week I guess&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I did nothing at all this week except watching Netflix. I managed to watch the entire Jessica Jones season 1 though so I&amp;rsquo;m both proud and appalled about my accomplishment.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing that much last week. Instead of staring designing or coding the 2d rendering system I started on separating the engine repo from the game repo, but nothing is complete yet. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to finish it this week.</description>

      <description>This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, except implementing radix sort with count sort as the second sorter. Pretty standard I guess but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my toolbox library and I will need it for the upcoming render optimization</description>

      <description>This week I replaced the built-in assert with a custom one to get callstack information, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also finally completed the rewrite of the new opengl buffer rendering.</description>
