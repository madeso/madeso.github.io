      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I restored the input system from an old project and started integrating it into tred&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I got back into 3d rendering. I added basic face culling, simplified the mesh generation a bit and cleaned up the resource embed module. Not much but also not bad :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I created a simple script to backup my git repos and read up on animation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I switched tred to pitchfork layout and refactored it. I also spent most of my time on the &amp;lsquo;kittens game&amp;rsquo;, what a time waster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I looked into the markov-chains parts of euphoria (again), refactored a bit and expanded with a &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; test, a bit of fun really. I also thought about how I want to lay out the vertex attributes in tred. It currently is 100% dynamic butit will be easier if it&amp;rsquo;s static. A few days I ago I was sure I wanted a 50/50 approach but since I have to deal with all the dynamic issues anyway I might as well benefit from the potential space spacing and use 100% dynamic attributes. Time will tell what I&amp;rsquo;ll decide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked both a little on ride(scrolling in fileview and expanding folders) and a little bit on tred(refactored profiling and added a plane mesh). Hopefully next week I make some decent progress on tred as I want to get it to a usefule state before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I resurected ride and started implementing it more or less from scratch. Well, less wx and more custom so not from scratch, hopefully by the end of next week I can soon integrate most of the old code that still is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started work on the inerpreter part of the fel language/implementation and a little bit of constexpr for the euphoria engine. Most of the week however has been planning for the new appartment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel, since I realized that it would be great if I could have the interpreter run scripts and functions this year and let the &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; of the language come later but keeping the api the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on basic profiler for tred, I picked up euphoria and started cleaning up the cmake setup and continued work on gaf so that it&amp;rsquo;s more streamlined faster testing and contains the features that I want in euphoria&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed so that the euphoria tracery could handle extended json and added some more design notes for tred. I actually also started on a new project textgen where you generate textures by drawing graphs or writing lua code. Nothing to show yet but I only worked on it for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I copied the script used to create the &amp;lsquo;game programming patterns&amp;rsquo; book and rewrote most of it to be generic instead of tied to a specific book. Apperently it didn&amp;rsquo;t support ebook generation so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add that eventually. The rest of the week was spent on reading up on engine design and some refactoring of tred so no new major features.&lt;/p&gt;
