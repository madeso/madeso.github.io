      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I basically just went through the entire list of errors that clang-tidy
can detect and decided what to use, and what to ignore, and fixed several warnings.
Then I continued workin on my protobuf replacement library, gaf, that I started ages ago.
Hopefully within a week or two I can replace protobuf in euphoria soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the component system, and added a way to both create
and remove objects dynamically, though my current system for referencing script
objects is lacking, so I need to fix that next week before things starts to get
out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on creating objects dynamically but it seems that I need to
replace my component/entity engine first. I was planning to do so anyway since I
dont like how it integrates with script defined components, but I thought this
was something to do later. I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on writing the wrapper. It is pretty much almost done now.
I know I said it was going to be done this week, but what can I say, things took
longer than expected :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on replacing dukglue, my javascrip engine wrapper with a
custom wrapper. While it is not completed yet, I got a good feeling about this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added a crash display, so that the game enters a &amp;ldquo;blue screen&amp;rdquo; instead
of crashing. At first I used my own built in debug print but then I replaced it with
the much nicer dear imgui display. I also moved my duktape wrapper to core and
started reasearching into replacing dukglue with a custom much simpler system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished up the basic javascript test that I wrote last week, and
after two days of struggling on how to design the API I just went ahead and added
the bare minimum input handling: keyboard buttons. Sooner or later I have to figure
out how I should handle joysticks, gamepads, touch controls, vr controls,
virtual buttons on touch controls etc. etc, but so far the everything is data driven, so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed the javascript issue I was having. Still considering to write
my own custom library, but that will have to wait. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 10 weeks until ludum
dare so I have to get a move on if I want to use my framework for the game jam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I still mostly recovered from the flue. When I actually managed to find
the time to code, I fought the duktype/dukglue registration of custom classes.
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m considering discarding dukglue and writing my own simpler version.&lt;/p&gt;
