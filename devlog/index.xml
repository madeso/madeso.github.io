      <description>Last week was kinda productive despite a birthday party in Germany. I finally started on gaf, the game format file format generator, and separated the game and the engine part of spacetyper into super and sub repos.</description>

      <description>Last week wasn&amp;rsquo;t that eventful. Life got in my way I guess so no code was neither written nor committed. Better luck next(this) week I guess&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I did nothing at all this week except watching Netflix. I managed to watch the entire Jessica Jones season 1 though so I&amp;rsquo;m both proud and appalled about my accomplishment.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing that much last week. Instead of staring designing or coding the 2d rendering system I started on separating the engine repo from the game repo, but nothing is complete yet. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to finish it this week.</description>

      <description>This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, except implementing radix sort with count sort as the second sorter. Pretty standard I guess but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my toolbox library and I will need it for the upcoming render optimization</description>

      <description>This week I replaced the built-in assert with a custom one to get callstack information, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also finally completed the rewrite of the new opengl buffer rendering.</description>
