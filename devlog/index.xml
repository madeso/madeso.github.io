      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on my arch config quest. I updated my aur tool to be able to write updated dependencies per install instead of globally. It now also can tell the git commits between when you last wrote and the latest. I started writing a tool to create a new localized mirrors file based on the official one. Finally I started writing on a simple script to extract pngs at various resolutions from a svg file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did a little on the json library but most of my time has either been spent on watch netflix and updating my arch installation. I switched over to dimming inactive windows and hiding the titlebar to get more screen estate and with the current compton settings, things actually look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started writing a json parser. I spent a little time on my AUR script, and wrote a script to randomly select a background. THere is still a few things to fix on my arch/i3 config before I can actually switch to it, on oh boy I am longing for the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent some more time on my aur tool. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite there just yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting there. I also resurected my tracery implementation and merged my tracery repo into euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started watching Umbrella Academy, and I&amp;rsquo;m liking it so far. I also added return values to fel, continued playing around with ncurses and started working on my aur tool for arch linux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel. I did a little bit of refactoring and started adding a bytecode. Rest of the week was spent on either rewatching the first season of battlestar galactica or getting up to speed on star trek discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I took a fel break and mostly spent it on implementing a table print function. I also threw out most of the fel parser and started writing a AST and runner, currently it can only print strings but with this approach it can be extended instead of writing it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent creating my custom scripting language fel. It&amp;rsquo;s currently only parsing, but it&amp;rsquo;s parses the whole specification written so far.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the bfxr installations so that the build generates a installer and uploads it so people can use it, unfortunatly it looks like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so I have to investigate why. I also spent some time on euphoria making the vector/point refactor compile and I started a test if lua is a better scripting engine than js. So far I am not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I went to the library to read Scientific American from 78 to learn how a pink noise algorithm worked. I also continued working on my bfxr port.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working, so my time is less than it was before, though I started to port the bfxr tool from flash back to c++ so I can use it again without problems. Still a few things to do but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I really didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I mostly did xmas things and a little bit of dot file tweakings.&lt;/p&gt;
