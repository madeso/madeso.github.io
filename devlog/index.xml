      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued cleaning and documenting the code and started the gamma correction work for klotter. Hopefully it will done by the end of next week but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week added a option to disable the debugging information, added header hero to the ci, added code so that klotter requests the high performance GPU by default and fixed a bug for loading textures from a pixel &amp;hellip; and that concludes the cleanup task so now I can finally continue with the rendering tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on cleaning up klotter. I removed the dependency on my current build setup on windows and added windows to the CI. I also expanded the test CI and fixed all clang-tidy warnings. Next week is finishing up fixing warnings and hopefully finally implementing gamma correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I contnued labeling objects in klotter. While labling is complete, there are a few more steps to take before I can continue on gamma correction and hdr rendering, but I hope that I atleast can start on gamma correction next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week started out with me adding code generation support to glox but transitioned back to kotter when I was told that my problem could be solved by the debug output extension and that my usage has been broken since 2017. After I fixed that issue glox was less interesting and so I actually just continued working on klotter and completed the anti aliasing task, so next week I&amp;rsquo;ll continue with the cleanup task and perhaps start on gamma correction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was away from my computer so I mostly just wrote documentation and added todos for code that didn&amp;rsquo;t look like it was correct or could use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly worked on klotter, lots of cleanup but finally upgraded the code to work with MSAA. Still some more steps to be done and I&amp;rsquo;m on a mini vacation next week but hopefully after I&amp;rsquo;m back I can continute completing the MSAA task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The only read progress I made this  week was adding blinn-phong specular rendering to klotter. I also spent time figuring out how to expand the current system to add gamma correction and HDR/bloom rendering and when to transform between the linear and the gamma color spaces. Next week will hopefully be the time that I&amp;rsquo;ll implement it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finally completed the instancing rendering and directly started to look into antialiasing, blinn-phong and gamma correction. Hopefully all those will be implemented next week, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on klotter instancing implementation. I think most of the code is finally written, now I just need to make it not crash and work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I made the copyright work like tags on my hugo spotlight page, forma compiles and runs  and I took one more step towards instancing. While forma probably will get some cleanup love this week I really hope instancing will be runnable the next week. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I managed to get most of forma to compile on windows. I also realized that smide might need a php-like code generator instead of the current mustache-based generator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I realy didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I added a few things to smide. Next week is easter and I hope I both will have the time and be motivated enough to get out of this slump&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I also didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much. I started a new project, smide, focusing on code generation and that&amp;rsquo;s about all I did this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much development, I mostly looked at workbench or catching up on star trek when I should have been working on klotter. Perhaps next week will be more focused on the things that I want to work on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly watched star trek. I did some small things on euph and made the FSE, full screen effect, optional. After sleeping on it, and thinking about it for a day I probably going to remove the option to toggle the FSE&#xA;as it didn&amp;rsquo;tappear to  affect loading time as much as I thought it would, and the if complicates a already complicated code base. March and April is supposed to be when I work on the 3d rendering and to that end I did look at instancing again and I now think that it will be easier to implement than I initially thought, perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m going to get it done next week &amp;hellip;if I don&amp;rsquo;t spend so much time watching star trek :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I more or less comleted the rest of the base sprint and can continue with the 3d rendering phase. It has slowly started and the next step is excluding and removing complexity and then, finally, instancing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I replaced all external code analysis and code coverage tools for euphoria and finally replaced them with tools that are run locally.&#xA;Since March has started I should move on to the next &amp;ldquo;sprint&amp;rdquo; but I really want to get a 100% function coverage. The start of the next sprint is completing the klotter project so technically&#xA;I can work on both, at least until the klotter project is complete so that&amp;rsquo;s most likely what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do. Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I got sidetracked and started to look into ubiquity, but even worse I think I took the wrong approach when starting to add types and trying to understand the code. Now I think the best way is to get a version running first before I start adding types &amp;hellip; but that will probably not be next week. I both need and want to get back to euphoria and klotter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on workbench dependency injection and finally managed to run a simple clang-tidy as part of a unit/integration test. On euphoria side I continued on cleaning up the code. I discovered a way to run regex on strings so I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to take advantage of that when I implement 100% function coverage later on. I finally did a little bit of planning and decided that the cleanup process should last at maximum to the end of february. Pretty realistic goal, I think, and hopefully I can finish it before then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started work on the yearly review of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done the last year. Among other things I&amp;rsquo;ve work on was creating the clang-tidy html report and trying to get ride/pony, removing the rust and gui focus and getting it to a useful state where I can dogfeed it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, last year, I started replacing the depndency on external coverage reports by also publishing the html report. The next year I continued with showing a the code city of the current euphoria and displaying the clang-tidy warnings on the demo html page. I also caught a fever that I&amp;rsquo;m recovring from so that&amp;rsquo;s perhaps why I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on instancing, maybe next week&amp;hellip; :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week of the year, but still 2-ish more days of completing the instacing API. Other than not working on instancing I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on cleaning up euphoria for the car game. I think one of my new years resolutions will be making and publishing the car game is some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost end of the year, I didn&amp;rsquo;t work on instancing but I did some big changes in euphoria. I &amp;ldquo;removed&amp;rdquo; pretty much everything and started refactoring the base project. I bumped the unbuntu CI builder and with the new linter comes a new list of warnings to fix or silence. When that is done I can start working on the new dear imgui based editor app with undo/redo support, at least until the 3d rendering is &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo;. My goal before the end of the year is to finally complete the instancing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started to get back into klotter and actually upgraded the glad and opengl version to be the latest that my machines support. I also continued on my kdl project, I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat considering to replace json with kdl in euphoria. next week will be the day I implement in klotter, I promise!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Countrary to my plans I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much this week, mostly just some simple extension to the workbench/buidl project to display statistics on the files you&amp;rsquo;re about to commit. Next week, for sure this time, I need to continue on klotter and get instancing working&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I sent another email to Mike Acton about my flipcode clone, hoping this results in a better response than twitter DM (:/) otherwise I mmostly worked on flipcode. I was going to get back into rendering but for one reason or another it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen this weekend either. Perhaps next week. I&amp;rsquo;m really keen on working on the arcade car game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides a few minor changes in workbench and bookshelf I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been reading code and trying to understand code, upcomming features for world/level building and whatnot. next week should be lots of work on fyro, finally trying to get the collision code working&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much I started reading open JK code but I spent most of the week learning &amp;ldquo;hacking for developers&amp;rdquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will complete it before my eval ends next week so I just have to hope I can continue the course when work gives me access again. I atleast managed to upgraded my static page generator to the latest .net lts and started thinking about perhaps completing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on the type system. Variables have types but they can&amp;rsquo;t be set from script. Currently printing the argument information for functions crashes and I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on making sure that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fyro. I finally completed the code restructuring and stared doing some small changes, now inheritance support inheriting from classes in namespaces, how about that? I did a rough breakdown of object/object collision and what needs to happen before I can actually start writing code for it and that ball will start rolling next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued with the duplicate removal and merging altdev archive to single posts. It&amp;rsquo;s going slower than I wanted but it&amp;rsquo;s progressing at least. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m adding extensions to exstensionless images. I also restarted work on fyro, making the code cleaner so I can add object/object collision and response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on the altdev archive. I converted the last html to markdown yesterday and it&amp;rsquo;s looking fine. Some small manual cleanup remains. Current step is to algorithmically remove duplicates and it basically consists of looking at various duplicates and see if I can detect and fix patterns early on. Then, and hopefully I can start on this before the end of the week, is copying the comment structure to the hugo setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on the altdev archive. I gave up trying to use pandoc and currently use tidy to convert html to xhtml that can then easily be parsed(mostly) using a regular xml structure. The output is about as good as can be expected when the html is kinda broken but the result is far better than what I had with pandoc. A few weeks more and I think I&amp;rsquo;m done with markdown generation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been working on the altdev cloning. Categories are done and image cloning is almost done. It&amp;rsquo;s been running for a few days nowand getting closer to completion. Downloading many images, especially if there are lots of redirects, 404s and you want to be nice to the server takes time. I am also slowly coming to the conclusion that my main engine, euphoria, has 90% yagni in it. I&amp;rsquo;ve always added things that I found interesting and was &amp;ldquo;game like&amp;rdquo; but it has somewhat become a behemoth without any features to speak of and I&amp;rsquo;m strongly considering going over the code and yagni/sunsetting/moving most of the code to a legacy folder until I can find a good place for it. It&amp;rsquo;s working as intended but maybe that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough anymore&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on altdev, getting really close to having the text of all posts now. Extracting tags and categories is up next. Genesis is also comming along nicely. Copying the public documentation the doxygen comments I realize that reading detailed comments is nice, even though the comments aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly helping it is sometimes nice having some comments to look at when pulling hair out trying to figure out a problem. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a good enough argument in keeping them around but&amp;hellip;&#xA;The final project I worked on this week is actually a new one, one that I found when reading altdev. It&amp;rsquo;s a documentation system and currently most of the work is converting the ruby code to c# and me trying to understand it. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m having second thoughs about doxygen&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens and how it turns out in the comming weeks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on my altdevblog cloner. I started integrating multiple indexings. I currently merge 3 different timestamps but will probably increase to some more as there is still articles I&amp;rsquo;m missing. I also mostly completed the genesis transformation. It didn&amp;rsquo;t contain what I was orignally looking for so I will probably have to expand to include the extensions I was using and I am in luck because I&amp;rsquo;ve saved everything :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on updating the genesis 3d api, but most of the week have been spent on writing a god awful script to download AltDevBlogADay from wayback machine and replacing archive with modern links where it makes sense. There is some small extraction left to be done but I think the next major thing will be merging several mirrors, since apart from being slow apparently wayback also haven&amp;rsquo;t mirrored everything (404 errors happen). It could be that the page was in a bad state when it was mirrored, who knows&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented the IK to my vita animation testbed. I think this marks the project as &amp;ldquo;completed&amp;rdquo;. There still is chapters to be read but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will implement them, so I started cleaning up my animation notes. Next week will continue the klotter project and the final step is to merge the animation notes, perhaps  with some of the vite animation code into the klotter project, but first there is a lot of klotter to be done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Next week I&amp;rsquo;ll clean up and understand the IK code and cleaning up my animation notes. After that it&amp;rsquo;s back to klotterfinish up rendering so I can implement all of the animation on top of it, but that is further away than next week, so until then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m about to start reading chapter 9 of 15 and implementing chapter 8 so with any luck the anim project is soon finished and the knowledge from that can be applied to the kloter project&amp;hellip; and speaking of klotter, I really should just continue working on it and actually complete a render project once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I got clang-tidy running on Github actions and it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s the only big thing left before everything is green again for euph. I started thinking about replacing the coverage displays like coveralls that I&amp;rsquo;m currently using with something I can run locally.&#xA;This week I also restarted fyro/lox and removed the public/private requirement from code. It was pretty easy since everything was required to be public. Initially I wanted to go in a c# direction but I think a typescript direction is better for lox. It should be easier to implement and stay more true to the original language.&#xA;With the fyro work also semi-started work on a game jam entry, the goal if I continue on it is to work on the game/fyro for a week and publish a magic game. A nice break from work klotter/euphoria work, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I continue on it or go back to my regular projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued getting euph build working. clang-tidy is taking too long so that&amp;rsquo;s next. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to extend workbench and run multiple clang-tidy instances. That should hopefully cut down on the analysis time.&#xA;Next up is probably replacing the coverage report. I&amp;rsquo;ve grown tired of online services and want something that I can run locally. For the &amp;ldquo;coveralls&amp;rdquo; experience I should make sure the result generates a badge and it can be viewed in a browser. But this task lays beond the klotter work. I really want to continue working on klotter and finish the instanced rendering task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I accidentally commited to euphoria repo and for some reason all the builds started failing, so I worked on fixing them, including updating to the latest catch and the latest compiler that is installed on the runners. Next week I&amp;rsquo;m going to do some basic workbench things to fix more build issues and then 100% focus on klotter ignoring the euph build errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spend to some watching videos about gui development and refactoring my old widget sizer code that I might reuse for the gui system in euphoria. Regarding klotter I basically deleted all my progress and started fresh with a readme like development and wrote the actual usage&amp;hellip; and now I just have to implement the few functions so hopefully I won&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in details this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented 2 different versions of a finite state machine. I also came to the realization that I need to start &amp;ldquo;fresh&amp;rdquo; on the instancing so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I pushed clang-format settings and formatted the klotter code. I also started on running and fxing issues in my include order tool from workbench, it&amp;rsquo;s almost done but I might end up removing it if I can make clang-format do the work, time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added a callgraph and initial CodeCity implementation to workbench. CodeCity is still a work in progress, but fun/cool enough to warrant me spending the next week, and probably a bit more, on merging the dotnet branch to main so that&amp;rsquo;s probably what I will spend the next few weeks on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been playing cyberpunk and not really been writing much code, slightly considering taking a pause on blaggen because I&amp;rsquo;ve not had the motivation to work on it even though I want to, so perhaps a break and work on another project for some time is in order?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on my json library, trying to get it to parse sexpr like expressions with &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in json. Next step is to be able to pretty print it like a sexpr but I think I should work on other aspects and libraries first before. So I can focus my time and energy on things I&amp;rsquo;ll have use for in the near future&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly did research for hot reload and watched various youtube videos. I also discovered that chat-gpt is pretty good tool for brainstorming different names for games. Great for various working titles but I don&amp;rsquo;t think any will be final.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on blaggen and started writing my custom template engine, it&amp;rsquo;s not done yet but should be done &amp;ldquo;soon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added todo and started to refactor code in the blaggen project. A few fun features and some serious contenders to rival the giants. Kinda exciting&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started watching Star Trek TNG. I had a power blackout and was forced to spend time fixing my non-booting computer.&#xA;I also opened up my static page generator and tried to understand the structure but need some more time to remember where I left off before I can continue and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly watched netflix (again). I decided that I probably will take a brake from bosca porting and get back to my editor ride or my static page generator blaggen. Time will tell&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on Ride and actually solved the lagging rendering on Windows! This has lead to putting the other backends on ice and soon will result in me working on actual ride features again, but before I can do that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably upgrade the current dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued fixing clang-tidy errors in euphoria. I also decided what projects I need to work on so I created a plan for euphoria and continued working on ride, a project I&amp;rsquo;ve recently found a use for again&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed the last function names in euphoria. Now all the function names start with verb or verb phrases. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a good thing or not, time will tell. I also completed my entry in the kodsnack gamejam and started a new project called vecy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on Klotter. Nothing super interesting except that I resurected some old mesh generator code I wrote about 15 years ago. I ended up replacing most of it though. C&amp;rsquo;est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on workbench and fixing the detected issues in euphoria. I also started on a smaller rendering experiment called Klotter, with anti-goals so I hope it will accomplish part of what tred tried to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished the rewatch of Bobbys entity talk and fixed typos so that my notes compile. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably will soon start integrating it into euphoria. Speaking of euphoria I also started cleaning up the code based on suggestions by the tool I hacked together last week and I&amp;rsquo;m almost done cleaning up the code. When that&amp;rsquo;s done I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to clean up the python scripts and switch the main repo to the dotnet tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started removing templates from some classes since they were only used within tests while the rest of the code used the same type. I also added hugo import and custom meta data to the blaggen generator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added unit tests to blaggen and implemented the &amp;ldquo;top links&amp;rdquo; and watched Bobby Anguelovs talk about entity/object models and probably going to switch my system to something similar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I ported the last python script (I think) and continued working on cleaning up the build code. Then I started a new project (oh noes), a small(ish) static site generator. It started, at first, as a small project to see how big a static static site generator would be but I think, if it ever becomes useful, it would be neat if I could port this homepage/blog to use it. I know I missed a few features in hugo when I wrote the first version of this page, and if they are not present when my generator is &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo;, then perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to switch :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed warnings in euphoria and added implementation of tor curves. My new year resolution is that I should complete the tred project and integrate all the findings from in into euphoria and on that track I started cleaning up tred some more by splitting the headers into a public and private part. Turns out the rendering exposes some implementation details so I need to clean up the include graph tree and perhaps refactor a bit next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished TOS and started replacing all streams for euphoria with fmt. There are only 2 parts left but that whole section should be rewritten soon anyway so I figured I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. Besides a few commits here and there I mostly just relaxed after the spelsylt gamejam. I completed season 1 of Star Trek - The original series and realized I should probably create a list of the best episodes for each star trek series + season I&amp;rsquo;ve watched so I can recall the good episodes if I feel I need to watch some good star trek again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I a camera to fyro, &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; a failing HDD and watched a lot of star trek. I&amp;rsquo;ve also thought long and hard on the sprite rendering in fyro and I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I need to rewrite parts of how characters are rendered to support &amp;ldquo;override&amp;rdquo; single-use animations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added texture, sprite animation and started on 2d &amp;ldquo;pixel perfect&amp;rdquo; collision detection to fyro. This required me to start adding support for scripting classes to inherit from native classes and that is what I&amp;rsquo;m currently laying the finishing touches on. Hopefully by the end of next week I have some basic 2d topdown and platformer collision going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on lox, adding arrays among other things. I think this will be the last week of full lox as arrays marks the last major thing to add before I can start integrating it and find the real actual pain points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the second chapter in crafting interpreters and started to implement my own feature requests to lox. Hopefully sometime during the next week I can start integrating it into fyro and make som actual games&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on lox and finally completed the second chapter so now I have a working, but very basic scripting engine. Next week is refactoring so I can extend it with custom classes and begin expanding the language and library with more features&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on lox. I&amp;rsquo;m still not finished with the first section but I&amp;rsquo;m slowly getting there. Hopefully soon I can start integrating the first version into fyro and see what I&amp;rsquo;m missing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I actually continued reading &amp;ldquo;crafting interpreters&amp;rdquo; and restarted my lox implementation and I just recently added looing, conditionals to the language and unit tests to the build so I don&amp;rsquo;t break any features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I split the tred and fyro project to seperate repos. I resurected my textgen project, the &amp;ldquo;substance designer light clone&amp;rdquo; I started a year ago and continued my work on my implementation of lox from &amp;ldquo;crafting interpreters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I decided to work on ride and more specifically the rendering, so I started switching it to OpenGL, there still are things left to do but it&amp;rsquo;s looking more promising than the bitblit method I was using earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued refactoring tred to a engine and it&amp;rsquo;s now &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; in a runnable state. There is way more things to be done for sure, but for now at least most of the raw opengl calls have been refactored away into a render queue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added code coverage to the uphoria build and started compiling ride codebase again after it has been on ice for a while. I&amp;rsquo;m going to test replacing the bitblit quad rendering with a simple OpenGL rendering. It should solve all the scaling issues that the current bitblit solution has.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started writing on the blog post that will become the second chapter of &amp;ldquo;clean code&amp;rdquo;. Should be up sometimes next week. I spent most of the weekend with running clang-tidy and porting my clang-tidy script to workbench, mostly because I wanted a html report now that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen how pretty the header hero report looks :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly wrote a blog post about Clean Code Chapter 2. I found a project called Header Hero that I might incorporate into my own header tool and started to refactor euphoria core library so I can get a better flow/structure and in preparation of the introduction of PCHs. Hopefully all will get the compilation times down to some form manageable levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed the last of the compiler warnings. Now euphoria builds without warnings on w4/Wall+extra. Next up to complete would proabably be to port the last of the build scripts and fix any warnings in euphoria that they will find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on reducing the ammount of warnings euphoria generated. Thees things sometimes feels like whac-a-mole squishing warnings in clang and then find some new in msvc but it&amp;rsquo;s moving along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on tred. Cleaning up and mostly working on boring non-visible stuff. I started combining the 2d and 3d rendering and I think I have a pretty good API but it currently isn&amp;rsquo;t working. Have to look into why next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I got back into 3d rendering. I added basic face culling, simplified the mesh generation a bit and cleaned up the resource embed module. Not much but also not bad :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I switched tred to pitchfork layout and refactored it. I also spent most of my time on the &amp;lsquo;kittens game&amp;rsquo;, what a time waster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I looked into the markov-chains parts of euphoria (again), refactored a bit and expanded with a &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; test, a bit of fun really. I also thought about how I want to lay out the vertex attributes in tred. It currently is 100% dynamic butit will be easier if it&amp;rsquo;s static. A few days I ago I was sure I wanted a 50/50 approach but since I have to deal with all the dynamic issues anyway I might as well benefit from the potential space spacing and use 100% dynamic attributes. Time will tell what I&amp;rsquo;ll decide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked both a little on ride(scrolling in fileview and expanding folders) and a little bit on tred(refactored profiling and added a plane mesh). Hopefully next week I make some decent progress on tred as I want to get it to a usefule state before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I resurected ride and started implementing it more or less from scratch. Well, less wx and more custom so not from scratch, hopefully by the end of next week I can soon integrate most of the old code that still is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started work on the inerpreter part of the fel language/implementation and a little bit of constexpr for the euphoria engine. Most of the week however has been planning for the new appartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel, since I realized that it would be great if I could have the interpreter run scripts and functions this year and let the &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; of the language come later but keeping the api the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on basic profiler for tred, I picked up euphoria and started cleaning up the cmake setup and continued work on gaf so that it&amp;rsquo;s more streamlined faster testing and contains the features that I want in euphoria&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed so that the euphoria tracery could handle extended json and added some more design notes for tred. I actually also started on a new project textgen where you generate textures by drawing graphs or writing lua code. Nothing to show yet but I only worked on it for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I copied the script used to create the &amp;lsquo;game programming patterns&amp;rsquo; book and rewrote most of it to be generic instead of tied to a specific book. Apperently it didn&amp;rsquo;t support ebook generation so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably add that eventually. The rest of the week was spent on reading up on engine design and some refactoring of tred so no new major features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less heat this week. I continued on tred, added uniforms and attributes to the shader and I finally think I got a good design going. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on getting uniform textures working fully. The plan is to work in tred for a month or two and then integrate it into euphoria. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on tred, my temporary 3d engine. Nothing much got done since it&amp;rsquo;s currently superhot and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting behind a fan, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that for next year I&amp;rsquo;m getting myself an AC for the appartment cause this is unbearable. Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theese past weeks I spent in the hospital and recovering from said experience. Nothing major was done really mostly config/dotfiles changes. Hopefully I will get back to euphoria I netflix will stop interfering :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I changed to my main computer, started transfering my old PrettyGood.net from google code to github, and finally started working on euphoria again. This time I started working on a custom pixel editing program. It&amp;rsquo;s far from finished but I hope that it can be useful in a few weeks time for the GMTK game jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I ported a old anagram application from c# to python, I published and updated old &amp;ldquo;engines&amp;rdquo;, one called hmtest and one called pwn-engine, so I could run them, but it turns out that none of them was that advanced. I also installed arch on my main, so either this week or the next my transition to arch will be complete&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started refactoring bbcalc so it could in the future handle generating truth tables, and I physically moved things around so I now use arch as my main computer. It will probably be a week or two until I install it on my main machine, but not too long since this hardware isn&amp;rsquo;t really health&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I styled the doxygen output, added argparse tests and merged the new-argparse branch into master. I also started on integrating warnings from cpp-best-practices and it&amp;rsquo;s going to take some time to fix all of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on euphoria argparser, adding a custom parser for non-standard elements. I started on running clang-tidy and clang-format on all the code, but it&amp;rsquo;s not done yet. I may end up adding a few options to clang-format so it can work with my code style, we&amp;rsquo;ll see. I also manage to uncover a old codestat project. A project intended to run on your codebase and gather statistics over time. It&amp;rsquo;s still in the early days, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, due to covid-19, I worked from home. I implemented the drunken bishop algorithm and continued working on the argparse module. Hopefully I will get done with the argparse soon so I get get back to working on the cellular automata, sprator and my scripting language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I restructured the cmakes for euphoria, and finished the refactoring of the arch install commands, then I got stuck in netflix land and watched both  witcher and season 2 of altered carbon. Hopefully net week the netflix craze has left me again so I can get back to being productive :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on the raytracer, spent time on my arch install scripts since I&amp;rsquo;m preparing on installing arch on a new computer, but most of the weekend was spent on watching netflix since I just managed to update chrome on my main machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent mostly on arch installations, switching from my custom script to getting confortable with yay and trying to recover more computers that I can install arch on, but so far no luck. The weekend was spent on creating a entry for global game jam, and I expect it will appear under projects here soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my time this week have been spent either on reading or watching things. I really should just sit down and program for 5 minutes instead of watching random youtube clips. Next weeking is the global game jam, so I will atleast do some game things then :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t lot of dev time this week either. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at the bytecode and a basic assembler and disassembler for it. I&amp;rsquo;ve also commited a few rouge files found in the euphoria repo, but nothing major.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First week of the new year. I started replacing my cutom log with spdlog and updating paths from strings to a dir/file path struct and continued the work on parsing the synty assets that I bought during black friday. There is still some work before euphoria can load and render it correctly but it&amp;rsquo;s coming along&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the last devlog of the year and unfortunatley I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much on either euphoria or fel this week as I&amp;rsquo;ve spended most of it with friends and family. However I started replacing the custom log with spdlog so that is atleast something&amp;hellip; :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I forgot my plan and bought some 3d assets on a black-friday sale so I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most, if not all, of my time integrating my level editor t3d into euphoria and trying to make it usable. I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed so that it loads the tile meshes and I&amp;rsquo;m currently adding collision detecion so I can add selection and interaction. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added basic cp437 functions to euph and refactored the current font to use the utf8 character encoding instead of some unspecified encoding that looked like ascii. I moved some part of the rendering to core and replaced the rendering text on image with the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; core font instead of just the single built in font. With the increased intrest in text rendering/drawing with text and cp437 I looked into implementing part of the figlet specification, so that might happen. Finnaly I deceded to start pushing some fel code, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not working. I&amp;rsquo;m working on it and I still hope to have a fully working parser and vm before the start of december. I think that&amp;rsquo;s about it for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much dev. I went to a C++ talk and while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as interesting as I hoped, it got me thinking. Why am I using C++14? I based my decision on that I want to port my engine to android and I discovered that they have now moved to C++17! So in the near future I will update my whole library to use 17. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since it was based on a previous project of mine I have inteded to finish but didn&amp;rsquo;t for various reasons I&amp;rsquo;m gonna consider this a start for actually finishing that game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t work on the json reader as I was supposed to. Instead I worked on my bezier editor. Ideally I want the json reader complete before the end on may and a stable API a week before, so by the end of next week&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on my arch config quest. I updated my aur tool to be able to write updated dependencies per install instead of globally. It now also can tell the git commits between when you last wrote and the latest. I started writing a tool to create a new localized mirrors file based on the official one. Finally I started writing on a simple script to extract pngs at various resolutions from a svg file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did a little on the json library but most of my time has either been spent on watch netflix and updating my arch installation. I switched over to dimming inactive windows and hiding the titlebar to get more screen estate and with the current compton settings, things actually look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started writing a json parser. I spent a little time on my AUR script, and wrote a script to randomly select a background. THere is still a few things to fix on my arch/i3 config before I can actually switch to it, on oh boy I am longing for the switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel. I did a little bit of refactoring and started adding a bytecode. Rest of the week was spent on either rewatching the first season of battlestar galactica or getting up to speed on star trek discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I took a fel break and mostly spent it on implementing a table print function. I also threw out most of the fel parser and started writing a AST and runner, currently it can only print strings but with this approach it can be extended instead of writing it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the bfxr installations so that the build generates a installer and uploads it so people can use it, unfortunatly it looks like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so I have to investigate why. I also spent some time on euphoria making the vector/point refactor compile and I started a test if lua is a better scripting engine than js. So far I am not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working, so my time is less than it was before, though I started to port the bfxr tool from flash back to c++ so I can use it again without problems. Still a few things to do but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A mix between typescript and lua. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try and apply the same commtiment I used for the kodsylt, that is lets see how much I can acchieve during 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did some work on my synth project, starting to refactor the keyboard&#xA;input from the actual sound synth so I can play with midi input some time in&#xA;the future. I also made a skateboarding, mail delivery game for the gmtk2018 game&#xA;jam called &lt;a href=&#34;https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018/rate/299793&#34;&gt;Skate and die&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;The name is obviously a nod to the classic &amp;ldquo;Skate or die&amp;rdquo; but what can you do&#xA;when you get an idea that absolutly must be created?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on software synth, and participated in game jam but didn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;really finish it :( On the upside is I added a feature to the assimp library&#xA;and terminal application that I soon hopefully will add via a pull request.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week a heatwave struck, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really do much. I started on the&#xA;OnInit callback, but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I merged the main.cc from all various applications in the euphoria&#xA;framework, extracting all the copy-paste code into another utility file.&#xA;I also finally came up with how to best handle how to check for when objects&#xA;are outside the viewport, so that should be done soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent on watching luke cage season 2, adding enum support to imgui&#xA;option for gaf, fixed the issue with not resusing ids and started on writing&#xA;viewport handling. The latter is not quite finished yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I threw out the wx scimed/ninepatch editor and have now a improved&#xA;dear imgui version of it. There still are some non imgui like parts from the ported&#xA;code but things are looking better. I just started on the imgui extension for gaf,&#xA;and after that is completed I can work on saving json so I can close this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly finished the move from protobuf to gaf. I still can&amp;rsquo;t save&#xA;gaf files, but that will come after I throw out the current wxWidgets based&#xA;editor, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m working on now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I basically just went through the entire list of errors that clang-tidy&#xA;can detect and decided what to use, and what to ignore, and fixed several warnings.&#xA;Then I continued workin on my protobuf replacement library, gaf, that I started ages ago.&#xA;Hopefully within a week or two I can replace protobuf in euphoria soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the component system, and added a way to both create&#xA;and remove objects dynamically, though my current system for referencing script&#xA;objects is lacking, so I need to fix that next week before things starts to get&#xA;out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on creating objects dynamically but it seems that I need to&#xA;replace my component/entity engine first. I was planning to do so anyway since I&#xA;dont like how it integrates with script defined components, but I thought this&#xA;was something to do later. I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on writing the wrapper. It is pretty much almost done now.&#xA;I know I said it was going to be done this week, but what can I say, things took&#xA;longer than expected :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on replacing dukglue, my javascrip engine wrapper with a&#xA;custom wrapper. While it is not completed yet, I got a good feeling about this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added a crash display, so that the game enters a &amp;ldquo;blue screen&amp;rdquo; instead&#xA;of crashing. At first I used my own built in debug print but then I replaced it with&#xA;the much nicer dear imgui display. I also moved my duktape wrapper to core and&#xA;started reasearching into replacing dukglue with a custom much simpler system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished up the basic javascript test that I wrote last week, and&#xA;after two days of struggling on how to design the API I just went ahead and added&#xA;the bare minimum input handling: keyboard buttons. Sooner or later I have to figure&#xA;out how I should handle joysticks, gamepads, touch controls, vr controls,&#xA;virtual buttons on touch controls etc. etc, but so far the everything is data driven, so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s nice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I fixed the javascript issue I was having. Still considering to write&#xA;my own custom library, but that will have to wait. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 10 weeks until ludum&#xA;dare so I have to get a move on if I want to use my framework for the game jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I still mostly recovered from the flue. When I actually managed to find&#xA;the time to code, I fought the duktype/dukglue registration of custom classes.&#xA;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m considering discarding dukglue and writing my own simpler version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spend either watching netflix movies or coding on&#xA;euphoria/spaceyper. One of my new year resolutions is to complete a few projects,&#xA;including fish hunt, space typer and star collector. Of all the projects fish hunt&#xA;is the one that is most completed. Star collector comes second but that is an&#xA;android project so releasing that is another project entirly. Until next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on spacetyper and started a semi new project.&#xA;A basic chatbot. Given that I am leaving for xmas celebrations, the week isnt over,&#xA;and I&amp;rsquo;m switching to my laptop I probably will continue working on fishhunt for&#xA;the rest of the week. Stay tuned for next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly worked on upgrading spacetyper to the latest euphoria&#xA;codebase. I really should have worked on completing fishhunt but I wanted to&#xA;code some C++ for a change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Game is shaping up. Not much left now. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for a release next week or&#xA;the week after that, before x-mas at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I found a few assets and started combining them in unity. Given that&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s a small game, it shouldnt take that long to complete. Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I decided I should actually complete my older projects colelcting dust,&#xA;so I took an old project of mine, starcollector, and started polishing it.&#xA;I hope that I can actually complete it this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I implemented the ray-sphere collision, and tested it by highlightin&#xA;all the intersections. I realized that a simple check such as this would be suitable&#xA;for clicking on the closest object so I need to implement more acurate ray collisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I finished implementing the aabb collison check, but realized that I probably&#xA;need a sphere/ray intersection instead as that would work regardless of the rotation of the object.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the basic outline feature to each actor/mesh so I can highlight&#xA;the current selected tile/actor in t3d. I also started work on getting a ray so I can actually select.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I actually did a little work on t3d. I started on a tile library and&#xA;fixed a problem with the mesh loader in euphoria. I loaded the ambient color and&#xA;assimp defaulted to a black ambient, but since most models only specify diffuse&#xA;I added a option to assume the ambient color is the same as the diffuse color.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I rediscovered agents of shield and spent&#xA;way to much time watching episodes I&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. Then I spent some time on t3d,&#xA;but way way less than I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started on rewriting ride in rust. From the ground up. I have some&#xA;really basic custom input control in the GTK build, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to get a proper&#xA;text rendering system up before I can continue. I also started working on a&#xA;3d level editor that I need for any game. Not much progress as I just grabbed&#xA;the demo application and started removing things from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do that much. I sorted game ideas, and other non-game ideas. The most actual development I did was when I created a git alias to list all commit messages and created a wordcloud of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on the rect and image refactoring, added a few image&#xA;drawing tests and added base64 support so I can test image loading without being&#xA;dependent on actual files. Finally I updated the dear imgui library to get&#xA;access to the new color widget.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on the engine, loading advanced meshes, default&#xA;textures in the shader and replaced google test in favour of catch. At the&#xA;weekend I participated in kenney jam and made a breakout clone in unity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I was back on work and even though my time was more limited, I still&#xA;managed to do a little bit on the &amp;ldquo;engine&amp;rdquo;. I added clang-tidy and clang-format&#xA;as a optional step in the build process. I then continued on fixing almost all the&#xA;error that clang-tidy found. That took the better part of the week. Then I added&#xA;basic lightning to the engine demo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I mostly spent on binge watching Agents of Shield (again), and did some real world stuff, however I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d want to use my own 3d engine&#xA;for my next game jam, so I spent a significant part of the weekend on this engine. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that it will be in a useful state for the Kenney jam on a month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didnt do much, and I&amp;rsquo;m honestly not sure what I did except work related stuff, shopping a few new furnitures and attending a birthday party.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a little bit better. I watched a little bit of netflix, but converted the current deploy script from bash to python&#xA;so I, in the future, can add more advanced image rezising functions that hugo currently doesnt support. Then I pretty much&#xA;started the konmari appartment cleanup so I guess I wont get much development stuff done for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week should have been spent on either gaf, t3d or finishing the spacetyper menu but it was spent on finishing crappy series on netflix instead. I guess the blame is mostly on the bad cycle of beeing too tired and then just binge watching myself one more episode past bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued working on this homepage, scaling images to fit in the design and it&amp;rsquo;s taking longer than expected. I also finally restarted my tile based 3d level editor called t3d. Since it&amp;rsquo;s still in its infancy there arent any pretty pictures so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it here in the devlog for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was kinda productive despite a birthday party in Germany. I finally started on gaf, the game format file format generator, and separated the game and the engine part of spacetyper into super and sub repos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week wasn&amp;rsquo;t that eventful. Life got in my way I guess so no code was neither written nor committed. Better luck next(this) week I guess&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did nothing at all this week except watching Netflix. I managed to watch the entire Jessica Jones season 1 though so I&amp;rsquo;m both proud and appalled about my accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing that much last week. Instead of staring designing or coding the 2d rendering system I started on separating the engine repo from the game repo, but nothing is complete yet. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to finish it this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much, except implementing radix sort with count sort as the second sorter. Pretty standard I guess but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my toolbox library and I will need it for the upcoming render optimization&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I replaced the built-in assert with a custom one to get callstack information, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also finally completed the rewrite of the new opengl buffer rendering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
