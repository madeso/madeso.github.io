      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel. I did a little bit of refactoring and started adding a bytecode. Rest of the week was spent on either rewatching the first season of battlestar galactica or getting up to speed on star trek discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I took a fel break and mostly spent it on implementing a table print function. I also threw out most of the fel parser and started writing a AST and runner, currently it can only print strings but with this approach it can be extended instead of writing it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent creating my custom scripting language fel. It&amp;rsquo;s currently only parsing, but it&amp;rsquo;s parses the whole specification written so far.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed the bfxr installations so that the build generates a installer and uploads it so people can use it, unfortunatly it looks like it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so I have to investigate why. I also spent some time on euphoria making the vector/point refactor compile and I started a test if lua is a better scripting engine than js. So far I am not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on the installer and continous integration for bfxr. I finished the weekend by entering the global game jam and made a game about running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I went to the library to read Scientific American from 78 to learn how a pink noise algorithm worked. I also continued working on my bfxr port.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started working, so my time is less than it was before, though I started to port the bfxr tool from flash back to c++ so I can use it again without problems. Still a few things to do but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on my tiny scriping engine, but most of my time was spent on either netflix or tweaking colors in my terminals/dotfiles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I relaxed from the kodsnack spelsylt gamejam. Apprently I came third, so yay me. I also started on my own scripting language called fel. A mix between typescript and lua. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try and apply the same commtiment I used for the kodsylt, that is lets see how much I can acchieve during 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued my participation in the kodsnack spelsylt gamejam. While I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what I have achieved I might continue on and actually complete the game. It feels pretty good to play and I like the style of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on my kodsnack gamejam entry. I mostly going well but I think I might have failed to estimate how much it will take to create a platformer in my free time.&lt;/p&gt;
