      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I added some more tests, and added coverage. Turns out that even if you think you have 100% you dont&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I didn&amp;rsquo;t work on the json reader as I was supposed to. Instead I worked on my bezier editor. Ideally I want the json reader complete before the end on may and a stable API a week before, so by the end of next week&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent on improving my command line argument parser, though I noticed at the end of the week I might be able to replace my code with a library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued on my arch config quest. I updated my aur tool to be able to write updated dependencies per install instead of globally. It now also can tell the git commits between when you last wrote and the latest. I started writing a tool to create a new localized mirrors file based on the official one. Finally I started writing on a simple script to extract pngs at various resolutions from a svg file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I did a little on the json library but most of my time has either been spent on watch netflix and updating my arch installation. I switched over to dimming inactive windows and hiding the titlebar to get more screen estate and with the current compton settings, things actually look pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started writing a json parser. I spent a little time on my AUR script, and wrote a script to randomly select a background. THere is still a few things to fix on my arch/i3 config before I can actually switch to it, on oh boy I am longing for the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I spent some more time on my aur tool. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite there just yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting there. I also resurected my tracery implementation and merged my tracery repo into euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I started watching Umbrella Academy, and I&amp;rsquo;m liking it so far. I also added return values to fel, continued playing around with ncurses and started working on my aur tool for arch linux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I continued work on fel. I did a little bit of refactoring and started adding a bytecode. Rest of the week was spent on either rewatching the first season of battlestar galactica or getting up to speed on star trek discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I took a fel break and mostly spent it on implementing a table print function. I also threw out most of the fel parser and started writing a AST and runner, currently it can only print strings but with this approach it can be extended instead of writing it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
