      <title>4th Dimension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; In my quest to make a complete game with each engine, this is my second game. My first game was made with a homegrown 3d engine in OpenGL with ODE. This one however is in 2d and uses HGE and bass(through HGE). My previous game was made in a month, this was made in a week. The Game The game itself is based on a really old game for the mac that I liked, and I think it was called The 4th dimension, though I can only find a game dev company called 4th dimension. Anyway the game is 4 in a row in 3 dimensions. And as the original it is displayed in 2d. You can play against a friend or the computer(with hard and easy ai). As someone nicely pointed out, this should be played in 3 dimensions, but hey HGE can&amp;rsquo;t so I guess that if I ever remake this, I&amp;rsquo;ll make it in 3d&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty basic platformer made for ludum dare in 48 hours. Surprisingly fun because of the unlimited air dashing and matching sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://i.madeso.me/project/alone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Basic 2d shooter that never ends. Becomes a little tactical since the different enemies require you to aim and a limmited amount of bullets force you to venture to the middle of the level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A old gamejam game. There is nothing really that can be done in the game, as I ran out of time, but there was a interesting mechaninc with roundhousekicking as a platform mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first ludum dare. I managed to get something playable but there isn&amp;rsquo;t much of a gameplay. Still pretty good for 48 hours and C++ from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Office rituals</title>
      <link>https://i.madeso.me/project/officerituals/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just another day at the office. Drink loads of coffee. Smoke cigarettes. Take credit for your co workers accomplishments. Go to pointless meetings and avoid getting fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink coffee and smoke so that you can work efficiently. Everyone is working on the same project, but you win if you did most of the work ! You can steal each other&amp;rsquo;s work by working at someone else&amp;rsquo;s desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the meetings or your Boss will be angry!&lt;/p&gt;
