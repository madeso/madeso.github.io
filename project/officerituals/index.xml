    <title>Gustav Janssons Office rituals </title>
    <link>https://i.madeso.me/project/officerituals/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Just another day at the office. Drink loads of coffee. Smoke cigarettes. Take credit for your co workers accomplishments. Go to pointless meetings and avoid getting fired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink coffee and smoke so that you can work efficiently. Everyone is working on the same project, but you win if you did most of the work ! You can steal each other&amp;rsquo;s work by working at someone else&amp;rsquo;s desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, don&amp;rsquo;t miss the meetings or your Boss will be angry!&lt;/p&gt;
