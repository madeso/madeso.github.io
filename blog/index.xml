      <title>A fix for spotify filling up the C: drive</title>

      <description>I recently got a notice that my SSD C: drive was getting low on space and after a quick check with WinDirStat I noticed that spoitfy was filling it up with loads of weird files in the AppData\Local\Spotify\Data folder, even after I have moved my cache location.
It turns out the &amp;ldquo;cached location&amp;rdquo; is only the saved playlists, and the Data folder is the cached songs that arent in a playlist.</description>

      <description>I recently bought new shoes and needed to lace them, hence it&amp;rsquo;s time to google how to lace shoes again. Ians shoelace site is my favorite and I&amp;rsquo;ve been visiting it for what it seems like an eternity. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the competition, but I can&amp;rsquo;t find anything missing from it. It&amp;rsquo;s the best!

      <title>Keep your ubuntu-gnome from waking up at random</title>

      <description>I have tried using /proc/acpi/wakeup and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried looking in /sys/bus/usb/devices/SOMETHING/power/wakeup for devices that will wake up the computer, however I finally fixed my random wakeup problems with a tool called acpitool.
It is really quite simple. First you need to install it, unless you already have it installed:
$ sudo apt-get install acpitool  Once it&amp;rsquo;s installed you can list what you can do with it, and to make it works.</description>

      <title>Non recursive file searching in Nautilus</title>
      <link>https://madeso.github.io/blog/nonerecursivesearch/</link>

      <description>Recursive search is the default in nautilus (search in subfolders), but I prefer type ahead search(only search in current folder).
This is easy to change, but not very obvious. In dconf-editor navigate to org &amp;gt; gnome &amp;gt; nautilus &amp;gt; preferences and set the enable-interactive-search value to what you&amp;rsquo;d like to use.

      <description>It turns out google has removed it from various links, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long this link will last, but here it goes:

Pretty simple but it took far too long to find it.</description>

      <description>I like to view folders before my files with Files/Nautilus, and here is how to enable it:
In dconf-editor navigate to: org.gnome.nautilus.preferences key and set sort-directories-first to true.</description>

      <title>Test markdown</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a code chunk with syntax highlighting:
var foo = function(x) { return(x + 5); } foo(3)  $ echo $EDITOR vim $ git checkout master Switched to branch &#39;master&#39; Your branch is up-to-date with &#39;origin/master&#39;. $ git push Everything up-to-date $ echo &#39;All &amp;gt; done!&#39; All done!  You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.</description>
