      <title>Check Your Assumptions</title>

      <description>In November of last year I noticed that the time it took to process inputs in Ride was way too high, almost a full second between each key input and for a text editor that&amp;rsquo;s unbearable. I tried to tweak the event handling but nothing helped and lost motivation, put the project on ice and started working on other things.&#xA;About 3 weeks ago the motivation came back and I started hacking and refactoring on the code to support multiple &amp;ldquo;backends&amp;rdquo; for rendering and handling input.</description>

      <description>I recently realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing my devlog since 2017 but I have never compiled all the devblogs into a longer post starting from today. I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize and write a smallish review of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done on all my hobby projects the past year.&#xA;Euphoria Euphoria is my hobby game engine and to much surprise I did a couple of cool things related to it.&#xA;Code wise I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to code cleanup (replacing streams with fmt), both warnings and enabled warning-as-errors(with w4/Wall+extra), I also added both a clang-tidy and coverage step on github actions so I can keep the code clean and strive towards a 100% coverage for the core.</description>

      <description>I took Open AI: Chat for a spin and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get it to write a fictional conversation between one or more people that probably never going to have a conversation. Here are some of theese meetings that I found entertaining.&#xA;Sorry for focusing so much on Uncle Bob. He&amp;rsquo;s the name I think the AI would have read most about and the only name I can think of that has written about many various topics that could be discussed with various fictional characters.</description>

      <description>Introduction Clean Code, mostly authored by Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob, has come up lately in discussions and apparently it is still being read. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it and only read the responses about how bad it is and I&amp;rsquo;ve read that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty popular to hate on it and who am I to miss a trend. Join me as I read chapter to chapter and express my feelings and thoughts about each chapter.</description>

      <description>I recently got a notice that my SSD C: drive was getting low on space and after a quick check with WinDirStat I noticed that spoitfy was filling it up with loads of weird files in the AppData\Local\Spotify\Data folder, even after I have moved my cache location.&#xA;It turns out the &amp;ldquo;cached location&amp;rdquo; is only the saved playlists, and the Data folder is the cached songs that arent in a playlist.</description>

      <description>I have tried using /proc/acpi/wakeup and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried looking in /sys/bus/usb/devices/SOMETHING/power/wakeup for devices that will wake up the computer, however I finally fixed my random wakeup problems with a tool called acpitool.&#xA;It is really quite simple. First you need to install it, unless you already have it installed:&#xA;$ sudo apt-get install acpitool Once it&amp;rsquo;s installed you can list what you can do with it, and to make it works.</description>

      <description>Recursive search is the default in nautilus (search in subfolders), but I prefer type ahead search(only search in current folder).&#xA;This is easy to change, but not very obvious. In dconf-editor navigate to org &amp;gt; gnome &amp;gt; nautilus &amp;gt; preferences and set the enable-interactive-search value to what you&amp;rsquo;d like to use.&#xA;http://www.webupd8.org/2014/01/nautilus-type-ahead-find-feature.html</description>

You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.</description>

      <description>I really want to release a demo to get a feedback on the actual game, but there are a few things that I think should be fixed before I release a early preview build:&#xA;Redesign the hardcoded input system, I’m working on this now Add lights and shadows to the renderer, this will really help the player determine the depth when flying around and help immersion Add 2d rendering/menu, this will provide the GUI for the “press start to play” so the game know what control to accept input from Physics motor, this is perhaps the most important feature.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I posted, but I have been buried deep in rift and input development. Rift development is pretty much done and I have rift support. I have received my razer hydra and backed the stem system and I’m hoping I’ll receive my sixense stem system in July.</description>

      <description>I have started implementing the basic controls for both the keyboard and joysticks and to test everything out I added basic thrust and torque controls, and while this is really hard to control as each torque requires a counter torque from stopping to spinning I started thinking. The WebGL version of lander and I recall the original (I still can’t get it to play on my win7 system) let’s you enter the desired orientation and let a AI controls the torque thrusts.</description>

      <description>Development on the game engine has been slow this past week so this week I’ve been thinking about the background music for the game. I don’t know the actual graphical style of the game just yet but I think I narrowed down the musical style to either some slow form of swing/jazz like this:&#xA;Or some some ambient 80’s style electro music like this.&#xA;Given the I’ve already found some electro music that seems to be fitting and that lander used some similar music pieces, it’s safe to assume that I will be using that electro music during the early alpha builds.</description>

      <description>This week instead of talking just design I thought I would be nice to share some development ideas that I’ve been brewing for a while, and it has to do with distribution of the game. The obvious choice is steam, and probably the equivalent to the appstore on ubuntu(if that still exists and is flourishing), but a part of me wants to sell the game to all linux distributions and I can’t test that at all.</description>

      <description>I though this is good time to talk and clarify a little about the game and blog title, and how misleading that title might be.&#xA;First and foremost the game is not set in space. The game might take place on different planets and you might travel from these places, but this is not part of the game.&#xA;Neither is hustling of any kind. You are a soldier/mercenary/technician for hire, you do your job and you get paid, so no hustling whatsoever.</description>

      <description>I attended the nordic game indie night, and got to play flowstorm (that did a kickstarter) and realized 2 things: It’t a really hard game and that it’s also a lander-like 2d game. Check it out if you haven’t already.</description>

      <description>So I decided that I need to make a bigger game, a game that I can work on for a few months at least and not get bored. I shouldn’t have any complicated animations and should be “easy” to make. A basic renderer on the top of a physics simulation won’t be that complicated and could be fun.&#xA;I thought about remaking a previous game of mine, lolball, but all the design I could come up with was way to complicated for what I had imagined.</description>

      <description>Whoa… almost 5 months since last time! I gotta post more than twice a year 🙂&#xA;Anyways, I’ve been quite busy since last time:&#xA;My pwn game library is still in development. and I’ve entered ludum dare twice.. I’ve posted my first entry, let’s go cave exploring, earlier in this blog. My second entry for the “Explore” theme was “Xplorer – the game” a kinda unfinished 2-player game that ends when everything is explored</description>

      <description>Since last time I’ve entered Ludum Dare and actually finished at 75ths place and a bronze in community – yay me.&#xA;Since then I’ve integrated the half/16-bit float from the glorious OpenEXR-project into my game-library pwn.&#xA;I’ve also been thinking about creating a 2d level editor as editing text-files suck, and there doesn’t seem to be a good level-editor. Most of the 2d level editors are focused on tile-based editing, but I want a more free-flow sprite-based editor, like the aquaria editor(nicely captured by wolfire design tour) or the boingo editor that is briefly visible in their sga trailer.</description>

      <description>I probably should have posted this earlier, however I been sleeping and sobbing over the fact that I didn’t finish no more sweden :). A few hours before deadline all tiles in one layer went 3 tiles up, but collision-tiles were still in the same place. I though that was strange so I went to check the map in the (external) editor, and to my horror it didn’t load. No message, no crash nor any exception – just silence.</description>

I’ll be attending most of it, though I have to work at Thursday and Friday, which is a bummer, so Ive been thinking at what kind of game I’m be making. I’ve been thinking about making a simple plat former for some time now, and this might be good time as any to make it a reality.</description>

      <description>Given that I sacked tetris more than a month ago, gamedev has been pretty stale at the moment. I’ve been studying fighting-systems and analysing combo-lists for the fighting-system in survivors. The usual stuff. However since the last post I’ve been thinking about remaking Yo Frankie! with my tetris engine.&#xA;Tetris actually outlived it’s purpose, as the purpose of the tetris project was to build a solid foundation for survivors and all my other 3d games.</description>

      <description>I recently read scarabus’ post regarding guis and I wanted to follow up/ add a few notes of my own. Since scarabus considers blender to have the worst user-interface(ui for short), I’m going to compare it to other similar applications and guess why it might be non-intuitive.&#xA;So, beeing picky I have tried several mesh modelers. The imcomplete list is anim8or, google sketchup, misfit model 3d, xsi modtool, blender, art of illusion, truespace and wings 3d.</description>

      <description>I recently came to the conclusion that I wont continue tetris, and instead restart my third person shooter-beatemup zombie &amp;amp; soldier slayfest Survivors. I always knew I was going back to survivors, I just didn’t know that I was going to give up on tetris. In reality it has to do with I got bored and can’t come up with a satisfying way of designing the menys. It sucks really, but all of the time wont go to waste since most of the code is basic boilerplate and I’m happy with most of the layout.</description>

      <description>Since some time I’ve been sorting my music collection. Going though my hard-drives and Cd’s finding all music-files and moving them to a common place and with the help of foobar2000 place them in a sane directory-structure and keep them there.&#xA;Within foobar I sort the artists on the following script. This makes sure that The (International) Noise Conspiracy is among the other artist that begins with I.&#xA;$replace($replace($replace($stripprefix(%artist%),’|’,),&#39;[‘,),&#39;(‘,) That little script keeps things nice and tidy within foobar, but to sort I use these two massive scripts:</description>
