<h2 id="games">games</h2>
<p>THe only game I made this year, was a game made in 4 hours for the spelsylt gamejam.</p>
<p>I think one of my new years resolutions will be making and publishing the car game is some way or another.
I&rsquo;m really keen on working on the arcade car game.</p>
<h2 id="klotter">klotter</h2>
<p>The year started strong with implementing framebuffer/post proc, cubemaps, skyboxes and uniform buffers and continued with code cleaning in the end of february but then I just stopped and was stuck on instancing and having some sort of analysis paralysis and ignoring for most of the year before almost completing it before the end.</p>
<h2 id="learning-and-planning">learning and planning</h2>
<p>Instead of klotter I found other work, I looked into how to implement finite state machines, gui development, portal rendering and worked on reading the jedi knight academy source.</p>
<h2 id="animationvita">animation/vita</h2>
<p>I read most chapters of a animation book over the course of about 2 months, only skipping the crowd rendering, and that resulted in the mini-engine <a href="https://github.com/madeso/vita">vita <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. I won&rsquo;t use the code directly in euphoria but it was a good experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="euphoriaworkbench">euphoria/workbench</h2>
<p>I did work on workbench, my c# build tool and source code status app, not a major overhaul or anything but I optimized the clang-tidy build and ended the year by starting to replace the external coverage reporter with a workbench one that I can run locally. For euph I upgraded the ubuntu builder and moved most of the code to a legacy folder so I can focus on the car game.</p>
<p>When that is done I can start working on the new dear imgui based editor app with undo/redo support, at least until the 3d rendering is &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="blaggen">blaggen</h2>
<p>My static page generator didn&rsquo;t get much love this year, just some small fixes and a upgrade to the latest LTS. I want to complete at some point as it has some cool unique features.</p>
<h2 id="ride">ride</h2>
<p>I think my ride editor will get most of my focus this year. I can remove most of the rust parts and make a generic &ldquo;vs code&rdquo; like and &ldquo;prototype of the new year&rdquo; is a good name.</p>
<h2 id="genesis3d">genesis3d</h2>
<p>Genesis 3d is a old engine and I stated thinking about the API and how easy it was to use. I spent a month convering the c headers to c++ and added moved the documentation to a doxygen compatible headers. I realized that having some basic api documentation in plain english is kinda nice when trying to figure out why a function fails.</p>
<h2 id="altdev--flipcode">altdev &amp; flipcode</h2>
<p>About 4 months of the year was spent on cloning and converting a old blog called &ldquo;altdev&rdquo; from internet archive to hugo. It&rsquo;s close to completion but not yet ready for publication.</p>
<p>I also looked at flipcode. It still is online but the mobile version is pretty bad and it would be nice if it was better.</p>
<p>For some reason I have been thinking much about having a local archive of your favorite (static) webpages.</p>
<h2 id="blender">blender</h2>
<p>I finished both the blender &ldquo;rite of passage&rdquo; donut tutorial and the anvil. Hopefully there will be more finished blender products this year.</p>
<h2 id="fyro--lox">fyro &amp; lox</h2>
<p>For lox, I remove dthe public/private requirement and moving it in a more typescript direction than the original c# direction. I also started on type information but decided that it would be better to actually continue by making the interpreter into a compiler and vm structure.
The other side of this project was a lot of fyro work and preparing for object-object collision that will be based on the type system, but since that is tabled for later so will the object-object collision.</p>
<h2 id="bookshelf">bookshelf</h2>
<p>I like to read when I&rsquo;m commuting by train and for this winter season when I&rsquo;m commuiting I decided to rrevive and an old project and convert it to a hugo theme. This is bookshelf, a book like theme with some sample books that I can read on my train rides.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>Last year I concluded with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is any goal I really want to complete it is that klotter should be complete and integrated back into euphoria with the new and improved entity system and using lox so I can finally start making some basic 3d games using my own engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>lol</p>
<p>Hope this year will be better and more of my predictions/plans will come true.</p>
