&lt;p&gt;I never really liked the cockpit view of flying and driving games. It provies a sense of realism for sure, but I never believed it provided me with a view that I liked. Enter E3 2012 and the demonstration of the Oculus Rift. Together with a helicopter like transparent sphere like cockpit the cockpit view field of view that the rift provides and the slow speed of the craft it provide a sense of realism few games can match.
the oculus rift&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solves the where youâ€™re heading problem, but part of the game is also to avoid hitting walls. While things needs to be tested in game I have a few ideas, a system warning that emits audio when you are on a collision course with the environment, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
